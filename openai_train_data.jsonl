The guard bands guarantee that the cells in different voltage areas are separated so that power planning does not introduce shorts. By default, voltage areas do not have guard bands. To define guard bands, use the -guard_band option with the create_voltage_area or create_voltage_area_shape command to specify the horizontal and vertical guard band width for each shape specified in the -region option. The horizontal guard band width applies to all vertical edges of the voltage area, while the vertical guard band width applies to all horizontal edges of the voltage area. Note: If you also use the -merge_regions option, you must specify the guard band widths for each disjoint shape after merging. You would typically use this option only when all the shapes to be merged are abutted or overlapping and therefore merge into a single shape. The effective boundary of a voltage area shape includes its guard band; however, the effective placeable area of the shape does not. For example, shows the guard band around the PD1 voltage area that is defined by the following command: fc_shell> create_voltage_area -power_domains PD1 \\ -region {{0 0} {30 0} {30 10} {40 10} {40 30} {20 30} {20 25} {0 25}} \\ -guard_band { {3 1} } Voltage Area Guard Band To determine the effective guard bands for abutting or overlapping shapes associated with the same voltage area, the tool merges the shapes as described in Merging Voltage Area Shapes and then applies the guard bands defined for the top shape to the merged shape. For example, assume that you use the following command to define guard bands for the voltage area shapes shown on the right side of fc_shell> create_voltage_area -power_domains {PD1} \\ -region { {{0 0} {10 10}} {{10 0} {30 10}} {{15 5} {35 15}} } \\ -guard_band { {1 1} {3 3} {3 1} } {PD1} In this case, the effective guard band is the same as the guard band shown in which is the guard band defined for the merged shape. To determine the effective placement areas and guard bands for overlapping shapes associated with different voltage areas, the tool uses the effective boundaries to resolve the shapes as described in Resolving Overlapping Voltage Areas. The top shape retains it placement area and guard band; the effective placement area and guard bands of lower shapes does not include the overlapping region. Note that if abutting shapes have guard bands, they are no longer abutting, but overlapping, due to the effective boundary that includes the guard bands. For example, assume that you use the following commands to define guard bands for the voltage areas shown in fc_shell> create_voltage_area -power_domains PD1 \\ -region {{0 0} {30 30}} -guard_band { {2 2} } {PD1} fc_shell> create_voltage_area -power_domains PD2 \\ -region {{10 10} {20 20}} -guard_band { {2 2} } {PD2} In this case, the effective placement area of PD1 is reduced by the effective boundary of PD2, which includes its guard band, as shown in Effective Boundaries of Overlapping Voltage Areas"}]}

Synchronous control signals include synchronous load-enable, synchronous set, synchronous reset, and synchronous toggle. Synchronous load-enable registers are represented by a register with a feedback loop that maintains the same logic value through multiple cycles. Clock gating applied to synchronous load enable registers reduces the power needed when reloading the register banks. shows a simple register bank implementation using a multiplexer and feedback loop. Synchronous Load-Enable Register With Multiplexer Flip Flop Mux Control Logic Register Bank EN CLK DATA IN DATA OUT When the synchronous load enable signal (EN) is at logic state 0, the register bank is disabled. In this state, the circuit uses the multiplexer to feed the Q output of each storage element in the register bank back to the D input. When the EN signal is at logic state 1, the register is enabled, allowing new values to load at the D input. These feedback loops can unnecessarily use power. For example, if the same value is reloaded in the register throughout multiple clock cycles (EN equals 0), the register bank and its clock net consume power while values in the register bank do not change. The multiplexer also consumes power. Clock gating eliminates the feedback net and multiplexer shown in by inserting a gate in the clock net of the register. Note: While applying the clock-gating techniques, the tool considers generated clocks similar to defined clocks. The clock-gating cell selectively prevents clock edges, thus preventing the gated-clock signal from clocking the gated register. shows a latch-based clock-gating cell and the waveforms of the signals are shown with respect to the clock signal, CLK. Latch-Based Clock Gating Flip Flop Control Logic Register Bank Latch CLK ENCLK ENL EN CLK DATA IN DATA OUT CLK CLK EN ENL ENCLK The clock input to the register bank, ENCLK, is gated on or off by the AND gate. ENL is the enabling signal that controls the gating; it derives from the EN signal on the multiplexer shown in. The register bank is triggered by the rising edge of the ENCLK signal. The latch prevents glitches on the EN signal from propagating to the register's clock pin. When the CLK input of the 2-input AND gate is at logic state 1, any glitching of the EN signal could, without the latch, propagate and corrupt the register clock signal. The latch eliminates this possibility because it blocks signal changes when the clock is at logic 1. In latch-based clock gating, the AND gate blocks unnecessary clock pulses by maintaining the clock signal's value after the trailing edge. For example, for flip-flops inferred by HDL constructs of rising-edge clocks, the clock gate forces the gated clock to 0 after the falling edge of the clock. By controlling the clock signal for the register bank, you can eliminate the need for reloading the same value in the register through multiple clock cycles. Clock gating inserts clock-gating circuitry into the register bank's clock network, creating the control to eliminate unnecessary register activity. Clock gating does the following: Reduces clock network power dissipation Relaxes datapath timing Reduces congestion by eliminating feedback multiplexer loops For designs that have large register banks, clock gating can save power and area by reducing the number of gates in the design. However, for smaller register banks, the overhead of adding logic to the clock tree might not compare favorably to the power saved by eliminating a few feedback nets and multiplexers."}]}

All outputs are unconnected If you instantiate the spare cells before you perform physical synthesis on a block, the tool places and legalizes the spare cells during the subsequent physical synthesis steps. However, if you instantiate the spare cells in a block that is optimized, placed and legalized, you must place and legalize the spare cells by using the following steps: 1. Spread the spare cells by using the spread_spare_cells command. By default, this command distributes and places all the spare cells evenly throughout the core area. You can specify the spare cells to place by using one of the following two methods: To place specific spare cells, use the -cells option. To place all the spare cells that belong to specific voltage areas, use the -voltage_areas option. You can control the placement of the spare cells as follows: Specify an area within which to place the spare cells by using the -boundary option. Ignore specific types of placement blockages by using the -ignore_blockage_types option. By default, the add_spare_cells command honors all placement blockage types. Ignore the current cell density and place the spare cells randomly by using the -random_distribution option. Specify a percentage of spare cells to be placed based on the cell density distribution by using the -density_aware_ratio option. The rest of the spare cells are placed randomly throughout the design. By default, all the spare cells are placed based on the cell density distribution. For example, if you specify a setting of -density_aware_ratio 80, the tool places 80 percent of the spare cells based on the cell density distribution and 20 percent randomly across the design. 2.

To add shielding to the routed clock nets based on the assigned shielding rules, use the create_shields command. By default, the create_shields command Performs shielding on all nets that have predefined shielding rules, except those marked as frozen To explicitly specify the nets on which to perform shielding, use the -nets option. Does not perform shielding on wires that are less than four pitches long To specify the minimum wire length in microns on which to perform shielding for each layer, set the route.common.min_shield_length_by_layer_name application option. Use the following syntax to set this option: { { layer wire_length }... } Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. If you do not specify a value for a layer, Zroute uses the default minimum length of four pitch lengths for that layer. Note: Wires that are less than the minimum length are not considered when computing the shielding ratio. Ties the shielding wires to the ground net If the block contains multiple ground nets or you want to tie the shielding wires to the power net, use the -with_ground option to specify the power or ground net to which to tie the shielding wires. If the shielding wires can be tied to multiple power or ground nets, specify the nets by setting the route.common.shielding_nets application option before running the create_shields command. Note: If you specify both the create_shields -with_ground option and the route.common.shielding_nets option, the tool issues a warning message and uses the route.common.shielding_nets setting. Performs same-layer shielding To perform coaxial shielding, use the -coaxial_above and -coaxial_below options. By default, the create_shields command leaves one routing track open between each used track. To change the default behavior, use one of the following methods: Specify the number of open tracks between coaxial shielding segments by using the following options: -coaxial_above_skip_tracks This option specifies the number of open tracks between used tracks for coaxial shielding above the shielded net segment layer ( -coaxial_above true ). -coaxial_below_skip_tracks This option specifies the number of open tracks between used tracks for coaxial shielding below the shielded net segment layer ( -coaxial_below true ). For either of these options, you can specify an integer between zero and seven. Specify the number of open tracks between coaxial shielding segments on a per- layer basis by using the -coaxial_skip_tracks_on_layers option To disable shielding on a specific layer, set the value to -1; otherwise, specify an integer between 0 and 7 to specify the number of tracks to skip. Specify the spacing between coaxial shielding segments by using the following options: -coaxial_above_user_spacing This option specifies the spacing in microns between shielding segments for coaxial shielding above the shielded net segment layer ( -coaxial_above true ). -coaxial_below_user_spacing This option specifies the spacing in microns between shielding segments for coaxial shielding below the shielded net segment layer ( -coaxial_below true ). You cannot use this method when performing incremental shielding. Note: You cannot mix these methods of specifying coaxial shielding. If the generated coaxial shielding wires violate minimum area or minimum length rules, Zroute automatically patches the wires to satisfy these design rules. Connects the shielding wires to the standard-cell power or ground pins and the standard-cell rails To prevent connections to the standard-cell power and ground pins, set the -ignore_shielding_net_pins option to true. To prevent connections to the standard-cell rails, set the -ignore_shielding_net_rails option to true Creates the shielding wires such that they surround the shielded routing shape To trim the shielding wires so that they align with the shielded routing shape ends, set the -align_to_shape_end option to true. To force Zroute to create shielding wires only in the preferred direction, set the -preferred_direction_only option to true Note that the -preferred_direction_only option does not honor route guides to change the preferred routing direction. When you set either of these options to true extra effort is required to connect the shielding wires to the power and ground network and any shielding wires that are not connected to the power and ground network are deleted. For example, to perform coaxial shielding below the shielded net segment layer on the clock nets, prevent signal routing below the shielded net segment layer, and tie the shielding wires to VSS, use the following command: fc_shell> create_shields -nets $clock_nets \\ -coaxial_below true -coaxial_below_skip_tracks 0 \\ -with_ground VSS When you run the create_shields command, it reports both the net-based and length- based average shielding ratios, as shown in the following example: Shielded 82% side-wall of (reset) Shielded 96% side-wall of (clk) Shielded 2 nets with average ratio as follows. 1) 89.00% (total shield ratio/number of shielded nets) 2) 87.92% (total shield length/total shielded net length) Note: In some cases there is a slight difference in the shielding ratios reported by the create_shields and report_shields commands. This is due to graph connectivity differences between the two commands. When the reported values differ, use the values reported by the report_shields command. The difference in reported values is typically less than three percent, but can be up to five percent. If you use the -preferred_direction_only true option when running the create_shields command, but Zroute must use some nonpreferred direction wires for shielding, the shielding ratio report specifies the percentage of nonpreferred direction wires. By default, the power and ground structure is not included in the shielding ratio calculation. To include the power and ground structure within a threshold distance in the shielding ratio calculation, set the route.common.pg_shield_distance_threshold application option, which specifies the distance threshold in microns. fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name route.common.pg_shield_distance_threshold -value distance Note that this option affects only the shielding ratio calculation and does not change the routing behavior."}]}

You can specify multiple shapes per layer. For example, to create a custom via definition, use a command similar to the following: fc_shell> create_via_def design_H_shape_via \\ -shapes { {VIA12 {0.035 -0.035} {0.100 0.035}} {VIA12 {-0.100 -0.035} {-0.035 0.035}} {METAL1 {-0.130 -0.035} {0.130 0.035}} {METAL2 {-0.100 -0.065} {-0.035 0.065}} {METAL2 {0.035 -0.065} {0.100 0.065}} {METAL2 {-0.100 -0.035} {0.100 0.035}} } To overwrite an existing via definition, use the -force option; otherwise, the command fails if the specified via definition already exists. If you are using double-patterning technology, you can assign mask constraints to the shapes or the enclosure layers, but not both. To assign mask constraints to the shapes, use the mask_one mask_two, or mask_three keywords for the mask_constraint arguments when specifying the -shapes option. You would use this method if the mask constraints follow an arbitrary pattern. When you create a via with the create_via command, the via shapes inherit the mask constraints specified in the via definition. If the mask constraint you specify for an enclosure layer when you create a via differs from the mask constraint specified for the first shape in the via definition, the specified mask constraint determines the mask-shift used for all shapes on that layer. For example, fc_shell> create_via_def VIA12 \\ -shapes { {M1 {-0.037 -0.010} {-0.017 0.01} mask_two} {M1 {0.017 -0.010} {0.037 0.01} mask_one} {VIA1 {-0.037 -0.01} {0.037 0.01} mask_two} {M2 {-0.044 -0.010} {0.044 0.010} mask_one} } fc_shell> create_via -net n1 -via_def VIA12 \\ -origin {100.100 200.320} To assign mask constraints to the enclosure layers, use the -lower_mask_pattern and -upper_mask_pattern options. You can specify either uniform or alternating as the mask pattern. In either case, you specify the mask constraint for the first shape when you create a via with the create_via command. If you specify uniform, all shapes on the layer use the specified mask constraint. If you specify alternating, the colors alternate from shape to shape after the first shape. For example, fc_shell> create_via_def VIA12 \\ -shapes { {M1 {-0.010 -0.030} {0.027 0.050}} {M1 {0.047 -0.030} {0.084 0.050}} {VIA1 {0.000 0.000} {0.074 0.020}} {M2 {-0.030 0.000} {0.104 0.020}} } \\ -lower_mask_pattern uniform fc_shell> create_via -via_def VIA12 -origin {000.100 200.320} -lower_mask_constraint mask_two To report information about the via definitions, use the report_via_defs command.

To address this issue, a new technique, multiple patterning, is used to partition the layout mask into two or more separate masks, each of which has an increased manufacturing pitch to enable higher resolution and better printability. shows an example of double-patterning, where the layout mask is partitioned into two separate masks, MASK A and MASK B. Double-Patterning Example To use multiple patterning, you must be able to decompose the layout into two or more masks, each of which meets the multiple-patterning spacing requirements. A multiple- patterning violation occurs if your layout contains a region with an odd number of neighboring shapes where the distance between each pair of shapes is smaller than the multiple-patterning minimum spacing. This type of violation, which is called an odd cycle is shown in Odd-Cycle Violation If the spacing between any pair in the loop is greater than the multiple-patterning minimum spacing, no violation occurs and the layout can be decomposed. For example, in if the spacing,, between segments B and C is greater than the multiple-patterning minimum spacing, there is no odd cycle and the layout can be decomposed. No Odd-Cycle Violation The Fusion Compiler tool ensures that the generated layout is conducive to double patterning by considering the multiple-patterning spacing requirements during placement and routing and preventing odd cycles. In general, double patterning is performed only on the bottom (lowest) metal layers, which are referred to as multiple-patterning layers. The metal shapes on the multiple-patterning layers must meet the multiple-patterning spacing requirements, whether they are routing shapes or metal within the standard cells and macros. The metal shapes on other layers do not need to meet the stricter multiple-patterning spacing requirements. Multiple-patterning considerations affect all parts of the place and route flow. Depending on your standard cell library, you follow either an uncolored or precolored multiple- patterning flow. You use the uncolored flow if the cells in your standard cell library have sufficient spacing to the cell boundaries to ensure that multiple-patterning violations do not occur during placement. This type of library is referred to as a correct-by-construction library most multiple-patterning libraries are correct-by-construction libraries. In the uncolored flow, the tool determines the appropriate mask settings for the pins and net shapes. You use the precolored flow if the cells in your standard cell library have assigned masks on the metal shapes inside the cells. These assigned masks are often referred to as colors and this type of library is referred to as a precolored library In the precolored flow, the tool must consider these mask assignments to ensure that multiple-patterning violations do not occur during placement. The tool also uses the mask assignments to determine the appropriate mask settings for the pins and net shapes. The mask assignments are represented as mask constraints in the Fusion Compiler tool. You must ensure that the mask constraints are properly set before starting place and route. For information about the mask constraints, see Mask Constraints"}]}

For details see, Detail Routing When you run a standalone routing command, such as route_global or route_detail, Zroute reads in the block at the beginning of each routing command and updates the block at the end of each command. The router does not check the input data. For example, if the track assignment step is skipped and you run detail routing directly, Zroute might generate bad routing results. If you need to customize your routing flow or you need to run a large block step-by- step, you might want to use the standalone routing commands instead of automatic routing. Use automatic routing (the route_auto command). The route_auto basic command performs global routing, track assignment, and detail routing. For details, see Routing Signal Nets by Using Automatic Routing When you run route_auto, Zroute reads the block before starting routing and updates the block when all routing steps are done. If you stop automatic routing before it performs detail routing, Zroute checks the input data when you restart routing with this command.

When you use this mode, you can control where the metal fill insertion occurs by using one or more of the following options: -select_layers, which restricts the layers on which to perform metal fill insertion, as described in Specifying the Layers for Metal Fill Insertion -coordinates or -excluded_coordinates, which restrict the regions on which to perform metal fill insertion, as described in Specifying the Regions for Metal Fill Insertion When you use these options with the -mode add option, the tool does not fix density errors regardless of the setting of the signoff.create_metal_fill.fix_density_errors application option.

The default change threshold is 20 percent; to modify the change threshold, set the signoff.create_metal_fill.auto_eco_threshold_value application option. When you use the -auto_eco true option, the tool automatically determines the modified regions and layers, and then removes the existing metal fill and redoes metal fill insertion only in those locations; all other existing metal fill is retained. By default, the tool compares the current block to the version used for the previous signoff_create_metal_fill run. To compare the current block to a different block, use the -pre_eco_design option to specify the comparison block. Note: A change on a metal layer triggers metal fill removal and insertion on the adjacent via layers to ensure that no floating or hanging vias remain when the metal shapes are removed from the ECO area. If a cell instance changes, the tool takes a conservative approach and considers changes on all layers. For example, to remove the metal fill from the regions modified since the last time you ran the signoff_create_metal_fill command and then fill only those regions using the pattern-based mode, use the following command: fc_shell> signoff_create_metal_fill -auto_eco true You can use the -select_layers option to specify the layers on which to perform metal fill insertion; however, the tool performs metal fill insertion on a specified layer only if it is one of the automatically detected changed layers.

In addition to specifying the region in which the routing occurs, you can also specify the minimum and maximum routing layers for each of the rectangles that comprise the routing corridor. Routing corridors are intended to be used to route critical nets before signal routing. Zroute global routing considers routing corridors as a hard constraint, while track assignment and detail routing consider routing corridors as a soft constraint and might route nets slightly outside of the routing corridor to fix DRC violations. Note: If a routing guide overlaps with a routing corridor and its attributes conflict with the routing corridor, the routing corridor takes precedence. For example, shows a routing corridor named corridor_1, which is made up of six rectangles. This routing corridor is associated with the nets shown in yellow. The figure on the left shows the nets before routing, while the figure on the right shows the nets routed within the routing corridor. Using a Routing Corridor Before routing After routing To define a routing corridor, use the create_routing_corridor command. At a minimum, you must define the boundary of the routing corridor. To create a rectangular routing corridor, use the -boundary option to specify the lower- left and upper-right corners of the rectangle using the following syntax: { { llx lly urx ury } } To create a rectilinear routing corridor, use the -boundary option to specify the coordinates of the polygon using the following syntax: { { x1 y1 } { x2 y2 }... } To create a path-based routing corridor, use the -path option to specify the path and the -width option to specify the width in microns. Specify the path using the following syntax: { { x1 y1 } { x2 y2 }... } By default, path-based routing corridors have flush end caps at the start and end of the path.

You can split the chip-level constraints in to separate top- and block-level constraints by using the split_constraints command. Review and specify the relationship between the top- and block-level modes, corners, and clocks by using the set_block_to_top_map command. If the pre-clock tree implemented blocks, which have undergone CCD optimization, are used for top-level placement and optimization, then the ideal clock latencies adjusted dynamically by different engines such as CCD and clock-gate estimation on the clock pins of registers or integrated clock gating (ICG) cells inside the blocks might not be seen at the top-level leading to timing inaccuracies at the top-level. Promote these clock latency constraints from block-level to the top-level by using the promote_clock_data -latency_offset -auto_clock connected command. Apply the top-level clock tree synthesis settings and exceptions. If the top-level exceptions do not include the balance points on the pins within lower-level blocks, promote the balance points from the lower levels by using the promote_clock_data -auto_clock connected -balance_points command. If concurrent clock and data (CCD) optimization is performed at the block level, the tool derives median clock latencies for the block-level clock ports, which accounts for the latency adjustments that were derived for the block-level registers during concurrent clock and data optimization. Promote these block-level clock latencies as clock balance point delays for the block-level clock pins by using the promote_clock_data -auto_clock connected -port_latency command. If the lower-level blocks contain clock-meshes, promote the mesh annotations (annotated transitions and delays) by using the promote_clock_data -mesh_annotations command.

By default, this command checks for Blocked standard cell ports A standard cell port is considered blocked if none of its physical pins is accessible. A standard cell pin is considered accessible if the pin contains a via that extends to a neighboring layer, there is a path on the pin layer that is at least as long as the search range distance, or there is a shorter path on the pin layer that ends at a via to a neighboring layer. By default, the search range distance is two times the layer pitch. To change this distance, use the -standard_cell_search_range option to specify a different pitch multiplier, up to a maximum of 10. If you specify a value larger than 10, the command sets the value to 10. By default, the tool does not check whether via connections are fully inside the standard cell pins. To enable this check, use the -connect_standard_cells_within_pins true option. To disable the checking of blocked standard cell ports, use the -check_standard_cell_blocked_ports false option. Blocked top-level or macro cell ports A top-level or macro cell port is considered blocked if none of its physical pins is accessible. A top-level or macro pin is considered accessible if a legal path can be extended from the pin to a certain distance around it. This path can be just on the pin layer or can extend to a neighboring layer by a single via. By default, the distance is 10 times the layer pitch. To change this distance for same-layer paths, use the -blocked_range option to specify a different pitch multiplier, up to a maximum of 40. To change this distance for neighboring-layer paths through a via, use the -blocked_range_via_side option to specify a different pitch multiplier, up to a maximum of 40. If you specify a value larger than 40 for either of these options, the command sets its value to 40. By default, the command checks whether a pin is accessible in either the horizontal or vertical direction. To require that the pin is accessible in the preferred direction for its layer, use the -obey_direction_preference true option. To disable the checking of blocked top-level or macro cell ports, use the -check_non_standard_cell_blocked_ports false option.

Invalid real metal via cut blockages in the library cells To enable this check, use the -check_lib_via_cut_blockage true option. Shielding checks These checks detect possible issues with shielding by checking for the following conditions: Signal net shapes with a shape_use attribute of shield_route PG net shapes, which might be a PG strap or rail, but have a shape_use attribute of detail_route Signal, clock, or PG nets that have a shielding nondefault rule but no associated shield shapes, which might be caused by inappropriate shape_use attributes.

Missing performance or electromigration via ladder on a pin that has the is_em_via_ladder_required attribute Via ladder application options that do not have the required settings To enable these checks, use the -via_ladder true option. The check_routability command supports the following additional pin connection controls that apply to all pin access checks: Pin access edges During frame view extraction, the tool annotates the frame views with information about the pin access edges. By default, the check_routability command ignores the pin access edges and allows pin connections at any point. You can restrict pin connections to the defined access edges by setting the -obey_access_edges option to true. You can further restrict pin connections to the access edge mark, which can be a narrow rectangle, a short line, or even a single point, by setting the -access_edge_whole_side option to true. In addition, the command can report unconnected pins that do not have an access edge defined. To enable this check, use the -report_no_access_edge true option. Via rotation By default, pin connections can use rotated vias. To disallow pin connections that use rotated vias, set the -allow_via_rotation option to false By default, this command considers the following routing layer constraints when checking for blocked ports: The global minimum and maximum routing layer constraints set by the -min_routing_layer and -max_routing_layer options of the set_ignored_layers command These constraints can cause blocked ports only if they are defined as hard constraints. By default, these constraints are soft constraints.

Create a collection of the libraries you want to analyze, which is known as a libset, by using the create_libset command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_libset -name myLibset -libs {abcd1.db abcd2.db} When you perform library analysis, you can specify the libset name, instead of specifying a list of libraries. In addition, the tool uses the libset name, instead of using a list of the library names, when it generates reports, plots, and so on during analysis. You can include a cell library in more then one libset. 2. Set up the library analysis environment by using the create_environment command. The create_environment command associates a predefined libset with a process label, process number, voltage, and temperature, which is then used for analyzing the libraries. You can specify the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature of the analysis environment by using one of the following methods: Specify the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature values by using the -ppvt option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env1 -libset myLibset \\ -ppvt {{SS1p, 1.0, 0.6, 125}} Specify a predefined operating condition from the reference library by using the -op_conds option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env2 -libset myLibset \\ -op_conds SS1p6125 Specify corners from which to infer the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature values by using the -corners option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env3 -libset myLibset \\ -corners nworst Specify that the tool infers the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature values from the scenario and UPF associated with the current design by using the -auto_infer_design option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env4 -libset myLibset \\ -auto_infer_design 3. (Optional) Specify a naming convention for library cells and perform lexical classification by using lexical attributes. A library cell naming convention can help the tool identify cell families in the subsequent steps of the flow. For example, assume a cell in your library is named AND2D4WSULVT. This name is the concatenation of the AND2, D4, WS, and ULVT strings, which represent cell characteristics that are associated to a lexical attribute as shown in the following table: Table 3 Lexical Attributes for the Naming Convention of an Example Library Column Lexical Attribute Allowed Pattern Values for Example Cell lexical_cell_prefix_name lexical_drive1_name lexical_well_substrate_bias_arch itecure lexical_device_threshold_voltage You can specify the naming convention for this library by using the set_lib_cell_naming_convention command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 1 -pattern {[a-zA-Z0-9]*} -attribute \"lexical_cell_prefix_name\" fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 2 -pattern {D[0-9]*} -attribute \"lexical_drive1_name\" fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 3 -pattern {WS} -attribute \"lexical_well_substrate_bias_architecure\" fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 4 -pattern {ULVT|SVT|LVT|MVT} -attribute \"lexical_device_threshold_voltage\" Note: For a list of all the predefined lexical attributes, see the man page for the set_lib_cell_naming_convention command. After you specify the naming convention, perform lexical classification, by using the classify_lib_cell_attributes command as shown in the following example: fc_shell> classify_lib_cell_attributes -libset myLibset To report the lexical classification results, use the report_lib_cell_classification_attributes command. To report the library cells which are not lexical classified under the given naming convention, use the report_lexical_unclassified_lib_cells command. If there are lexically unclassified cells, specifies addition naming conventions and rerun lexical classification. 4. (Optional) Exclude specific cells from library analysis by using the set_use_for_library_analysis command. By default, the tool excludes physical-only cells during library analysis. However, you can exclude additional cells, such as library cells with a dont_use setting, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> set exclude_cells [filter_collection [get_lib_cells $libs/*] \"dont_use == true\"] fc_shell> set_use_for_library_analysis $exclude_cells false To report the cells that are excluded, use the report_lexical_ignored_lib_cells command. 5. Identify all library cell families by using the identify_lib_cell_families command. To report the tool-identified library cell families, use the report_lib_cell_families -all_initial command. To manually define library cell families, use the define_lib_cell_family command, and to report these user-defined cell families, use the report_lib_cell_families -all_userdef command. 6. Analyze the libraries by using the run_library_analysis command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> run_library_analysis -name myLibset_run1 -environment env1 The name of the environment you specify with the -environment option must correspond to an environment you previously created by using the create_environment command. 7. Compare libraries by using the compare_libraries command. When doing so, you must specify the two libraries you want to compare by using the -ref_lib and -target_lib options. In addition, you must specify the name of the library analysis runs, performed by using the run_library_analysis command in the previous step, for each of these libraries. To do so use the -ref_lib_analysis and -target_lib_analysis options, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> compare_libraries -ref_lib $rvt_lib -ref_lib_analysis sa \\ -target_lib $lvt_lib -target_lib_analysis sa -verbose -plot When comparing libraries, you might encounter the following situations related to name matching between the cells of the reference and target libraries: The cell names in the reference and target libraries can be an exact match, as in the case when it is two different versions of the same library. If so, additional lexical classification is not required. The reference and target libraries can have the same naming convention, except less lexical attributes in one library. For example, assume a cell named ND2D1SVT in the reference library matches a cell named ND2D1 in the target library. In this case, the target library cell names do not contain a lexical_device_threshold_voltage attribute, as shown in the following table. Table 4 Reference and Target Library Lexical Attribute Differences Lexical Attribute Reference Library Target Library lexical_cell_prefix_name lexical_drive1_name Lexical Attribute Reference Library Target Library lexical_device_threshold_voltage In this situation, you should ignore the lexical_device_threshold_voltage attribute when comparing the two libraries. To do so, use the following application option settings before you run the compare_libraries command: fc_shell> set_app_options -name libra.complib.match_full_cell_name -value false fc_shell> set_app_options -name libra.complib.match_lexical_device_threshold_voltage -value false fc_shell> compare_libraries -ref_lib $rvt_lib -ref_lib_analysis sa \\ -target_lib $lvt_lib -target_lib_analysis sa -verbose -plot Note: For a complete list of application options you can use to control name matching during library comparison, see the man page for the compare_libraries command. The reference and target libraries can have a similar naming convention, but the lexical attributes values might not identical. For example, assume a cell named ND2D1SVT in the reference library matches a cell named nand2_svth_x1 in the target library. In this case, the reference and target libraries have the same lexical attributes, which have similar but not the same values, as shown in the following table. Table 5 Reference and Target Library Lexical Attribute Differences Lexical Attribute Reference Library Target Library lexical_cell_prefix_name lexical_drive1_name lexical_device_threshold_voltage In this situation, you must create a lexical attribute mapping file that contains the following information: lexical_cell_prefix_name ND2 nand2 lexical_drive1_name"}]}

The voltage-related cell attributes are: current overlap_current effective_resistance timing_ window slack output_load and static_power Use these voltage-related cell attributes to identify root causes of voltage violations. For example, you can Use the current and output loading capacitance information to determine if a cell's high peak is caused by too much load. If this is the case, splitting the output might be an effective approach to reduce high voltage drops. Check and compare the timing windows in the current hotspot to those of the neighboring grids to determine if a cell can be moved to other grids (targets). Doing so reduces the voltage drop of the original grid without increasing the voltage drop of the target grid. Compare slew and load capacitance among all cells in the region to determine if high peak current is caused by sharp slew or large load capacitance. Find cells that have overlapping timing windows to identify cells that might switch at the same time during dynamic rail analysis. Here are commonly used options of the report_hot_spots command: Option Description -index -summary -object -verbose Listing Voltage Grid Boxes by Index By default, the tool searches three rows up and down and three columns left and right to determine the neighboring grids of the current one. Use the -index option to specify the index used to report voltage hotspot grids. The grid box with the smallest index number has the highest effective voltage drop values. This allows you to determine the size of the hotspot area. For example, if all the surrounding grids have bigger index numbers and only a few central grids have much smaller numbers, this voltage drop hotspot is assumed to be an island. Accumulating Current For an instance in a grid box, the overlap current is estimated by accumulating the timing- window-based current across its neighboring cells. The command scans all timing windows from smallest to biggest, and accumulates current on the way as time passes by. Use the information to determine how many cells are switching simultaneously and how much time shift to apply when shifting timing windows for voltage drop reduction. Assume the design has three instances with current as follows: As shown in the following report, the accumulated current on point 2.0 is from inst2 and inst3, and does not include the current from inst1. inst1 [0.0 2.0] current 0.11 inst2 [1.0 2.5] current 0.22 inst3 [2.0 3.0] current 0.33 See Also Generating Hotspots Removing Hotspots Voltage Hotspot Analysis Examples"}]}

This is a high-level optimization technique that can save a significant amount of power by adding clock gates to registers that are not always enabled and have synchronous load- enable or explicit feedback loops. The tool gates flip-flops by extracting common enable signals shared by the flip-flops either in the same hierarchy or across hierarchies. This technique greatly reduces dynamic power consumption by reducing the switching activity on the clock inputs to registers and eliminating the multiplexers. It can also result in a smaller chip area. Clock gating occurs by default during the compile_fusion command using specified clock-gating settings. If you do not specify any clock-gating constraints, the default constraints are used. While you cannot disable clock gating, you can use the clock-gating commands in this section to prevent insertion of clock gates in specific blocks or the whole design. The tool identifies preexisting clock-gating cells during the analyze and elaborate commands. The tool inserts one more level of clock-gating cells at the leaf level.

During clock tree synthesis and optimization, the tool propagates the nondefault routing rules to the newly created clock nets. set_routing_rule This command assigns nondefault routing rules to signal nets and to clock nets after clock tree synthesis. The following topics describe how to assign nondefault routing rules to nets: Assigning Nondefault Routing Rules to Clock Nets Assigning Nondefault Routing Rules to Signal Nets Reporting Nondefault Routing Rule Assignments Assigning Nondefault Routing Rules to Clock Nets To assign a clock routing rule to a clock net, use the -rule option with the set_clock_routing_rules command. The specified rule must be a rule that you previously defined with the create_routing_rule command. To reset a clock routing rule to the default routing rule, use the -default_rule option. To change a clock routing rule, first reset it to the default routing rule and then use the -rule option after resetting the assignment to the default routing rule. By default, the set_clock_routing_rules command assigns the specified clock routing rule to all clock trees in the block. Table 31 shows the options used to restrict the routing rule assignment. Table 31 Restricting Clock Routing Rule Assignments To assign a nondefault routing rule to Use this option -clocks clocks -net_type root -net_type sink -net_type internal -nets nets shows the root, internal, and sink nets of a clock tree after clock tree synthesis. By default, the root-net routing rule is applied to all the single-fanout clock nets starting from the clock root up to the point where the clock tree branches out to a fanout of more than one. Internal-net routing rules are applied to the nets from this point until the sink nets. Root, Internal, and Sink Clock Net Types Sink nets Internal nets Root nets 200 sinks 200 sinks 200 sinks The following example specifies routing rules for the root, internal, and sink nets: fc_shell> set_clock_routing_rules -rules NDR1 -net_type root fc_shell> set_clock_routing_rules -rules NDR2 -net_type internal fc_shell> set_clock_routing_rules -rules NDR3 -net_type sink 2. You can use this option with the -clocks option to further restrict the assignment. This option is not valid with the -nets option. To specify a transitive fanout limit to use when identifying root nets, use the set_clock_tree_options -root_ndr_fanout_limit command. For example, to specify that any clock net with a transitive fanout of more than 300 be considered as a root net, use the following command: fc_shell> set_clock_tree_options -root_ndr_fanout_limit 300 shows the root, internal, and sink nets of the same clock tree when a transitive fanout limit of 300 is used for identifying the clock root nets. Using a Fanout Limit for Selecting Root Nets Sink nets Internal nets Root nets 200 sinks 200 sinks 200 sinks When calculating the transitive fanout of clock nets for the purpose of identifying root nets, the tool includes only the valid clock sinks; It does not include the ignore pins. If a net identified as a root net is less than 10 microns, the tool uses internal-net routing rules for that net. Note: Specifying a smaller value with the set_clock_tree_options -root_ndr_fanout_limit command increases the number of clock nets that are assigned the root-net routing rule, which can increase routing congestion. During clock tree synthesis and optimization, the tool also honors nondefault routing rules set by using the set_routing_rule command. However, the tool does not propagate these routing rules to any new clock nets it creates. If a net is assigned more than one nondefault routing rule, the tool uses the following priority to determine the effective routing rule: 1. Nondefault routing rule set by the set_routing_rule command 2. Net-specific clock routing rule set by the set_clock_routing_rules -nets command 3. Clock-specific clock routing rule set by the set_clock_routing_rules -clocks command 4. Global clock routing rule set by the set_clock_routing_rules command Assigning Nondefault Routing Rules to Signal Nets To assign a nondefault routing rule to a net, use the -rule option with the set_routing_rule command. The specified rule must be a rule that you previously defined with the create_routing_rule command. You must specify the nets to which to assign the nondefault routing rule. You can assign multiple nondefault routing rules to a net. To change the routing rule assignment for one or more nets, Use the -default_rule option to reset the nets to the default routing rule. To assign different nondefault routing rules to the nets, use the -rule option after resetting the nets to the default routing rule. Use the -no_rule option to remove all routing rules from the nets and allow the tool to automatically assign a routing rule to them. Use the -clear option to remove all routing rules and net-specific layer constraints from the nets. For example, to assign a nondefault routing rule called WideMetal to the CLK net, use the following command: fc_shell> set_routing_rule -rule WideMetal [get_nets CLK] To reset the routing rule for the CLK net to the default routing rule, use the following command: fc_shell> set_routing_rule -default_rule [get_nets CLK] Reporting Nondefault Routing Rule Assignments The Fusion Compiler tool provides commands to report the nondefault routing rules assigned by the set_routing_rule command and the clock routing rules assigned by the set_clock_routing_rules command. To report the nondefault routing rules assigned by the set_routing_rule command, use the -of_objects option with the report_routing_rules command. fc_shell> report_routing_rules -of_objects [get_nets *] To report the clock routing rule assignments, use the report_clock_routing_rules command. This command reports only the routing rules assigned by the set_clock_routing_rules command."}]}

However, you can disable the feature for specific clock gates by setting a dont_estimate_clock_latency attribute on their clock pins. This topic describes how to manually specify latency values on those clock gates. Specify the clock network latency by using either the set_clock_latency or set_clock_gate_latency command. The set_clock_gate_latency command can be used for both gate-level and RTL designs. The clock latency specified using the set_clock_gate_latency command is annotated on the registers during the compile_fusion command when the clock-gating cells are inserted. However, if you modify the latency values on the clock gates after the compilation, you must manually apply the latency values on the existing clock-gating cells using the apply_clock_gate_latency command. Note: After you modify the clock-gate latency using the set_clock_gate_latency command, if you compile your design using the compile_fusion command, it is not necessary to use the apply_clock_gate_latency command to apply the latency values. The tool annotates the specified value during compilation. To remove clock latency information previously set on clock-gating cells with the set_clock_gate_latency or apply_clock_gate_latency commands, use the reset_clock_gate_latency command. This command removes the clock latency values on the specified clocks. If you do not specify the clock, the clock latency values on all the clock-gating cells are removed. The set_clock_latency Command Use the set_clock_latency command to specify clock network latency for specific clock- gating cells. In lat_cgtoreg is the estimated delay from the clock pin of the clock-gating cell to the clock pin of the gated register and lat_reg is the estimated clock-network latency to the clock pins of the registers without clock gating. Clock Latency With Clock-Gating Design Clock- Gating Cell Register Clock tree delay Clock tree delay lat_reg lat_cgtoreg For all clock pins of registers (gated or ungated) in the design that are driven by a specific clock, use the lat_reg value for the set_clock_latency command. For clock pins of all the clock-gating cells, use the difference between the lat_reg and lat_cgtoreg values for the set_clock_latency command. Because the purpose of setting the latency values is to account for the different clock-network delays between the registers and the clock-gating cell, it is important to get a reasonably accurate value of the difference lat_cgtoreg ). The absolute values used are less important unless you are using these values to account for clock-network delay issues not related to clock gating. The set_clock_gate_latency Command When you use the compile_fusion command, clock gates are inserted during the compilation process. To specify the clock network latency before the clock-gating cells are inserted by the tool, use the set_clock_gate_latency command. This command lets you specify the clock network latency for the clock-gating cells as a function of the clock domain, clock-gating stage, and the fanout of the clock-gating cell. The latency that you specify is annotated on the clock-gating cells when they are inserted by the compile_fusion command. You can manually annotate the latency values on the existing clock-gating cells in your design using the apply_clock_gate_latency command. The set_clock_gate_latency command takes the following arguments: -clock clock_list -stage clock_gate_stage -fanout_latency fanout_list The fanout_list is a list of tuples specifying a fanout range and a delay decrement. In the following example, three fanout ranges are created: 1 to 5 with a latency value of 0.5, 6-15 with a latency value of 0.8, and 16 to infinity with a latency value of 0.6. set_clock_gate_latency -stage 1 \\ -fanout_latency {{1-5 0.5} {6-15 0.8} {16-inf 0.6}} To specify a clock latency value for clock-gated registers, use the -stage option with a value of 0. Because you are specifying the latency value for the clock-gated registers, the value for the -fanout_latency option should be 1-inf (1 to infinity) and the latency is the absolute clock latency value for the registers, as shown in the following example: set_clock_gate_latency -clock CLK -stage 0\\ -fanout_latency {1-inf 1.0} If the -clock option is not specified, the setting applies to all clocks in the design. Clock latencies using the set_clock_latency command have higher precedence and are not overwritten. shows an example of clock-gate stages and fanout. Clock-Gating Stages and Latency Calculations The following commands set the latency values for set_clock_gate_latency -stage 0 -fanout_latency {{1-inf 1.0}} set_clock_gate_latency -stage 1 -fanout_latency {{1-inf 0.3}} set_clock_gate_latency -stage 2 -fanout_latency {{1-inf 0.2}} set_clock_gate_latency -stage 3 -fanout_latency {{1-inf 0.1}} shows another example of fanout and latency calculations.

Use the update_indesign_activity command to perform the analysis, which includes the following tasks: Invokes the PrimePower tool and reads the design data which includes the netlist, libraries, PVT settings, constraints, parasitics, essential name mapping data, UPF, and so on. Library details come from the design database stored in the Fusion Compiler tool memory. Reads the RTL FSDB file into the PrimePower tool and performs time-based analysis to generate a gate-level SAIF. Reads the gate-level SAIF back into the Fusion Compiler tool. Set the power scenario as the current scenario before starting analysis with the update_indesign_activity command. Activity is refreshed for the current scenario. If you specify multiple scenarios using the -scenarios option of the set_indesign_primepower_options command, the refreshed gate-level SAIF from the PrimePower tool is read back into the Fusion Compiler tool for all of the specified scenarios. The PrimePower In-Design UI allows you to pass input waveforms using the native ZeBu database (ZTDB). The -ztdb option of the set_indesign_primepower_options command sets up PrimePower In-Design to create a script using the update_indesign_activity command. This script uses the PrimePower read_ztdb command to perform time-based analysis and issues a gate-level SAIF file that is automatically back-annotated into the Fusion Compiler tool. Specifying Distributed Analysis For faster runtime, use distributed analysis, which is disabled by default in the PrimePower tool. To enable distributed analysis in the PrimePower tool, specify the following options with the set_indesign_primepower_options command: -num_processes : Use this option to specify the number of hosts to launch. The value must be greater than 1. -submit_command or -host_names : Use either of these options to specify the configuration of host machines. -max_cores : Use this option to specify the maximum number of cores. The default is 4. The tool prints the following message if valid options are specified: Information: PrimePower is being called in distributed mode"}]}

Note: By default, only the hard congestion data is saved in the design library. To also save the soft congestion data, set the route.global.export_soft_congestion_maps application option to true before performing global routing. The command calculates the overflow as the sum of the overflow for each layer, ignoring any underflow. Example 26 shows the default report, which includes only the hard congestion data.

The total overflow value is the total number of wires in the block that do not have a corresponding track available. The max overflow value is the highest number of overutilized wires in a single global routing cell. The GRCs overflow value is the total number of overcongested global routing cells in the design. The GRCs max overflow value is the number of global routing cells that have the maximum overflow. Note: The overflow and global routing cell numbers reported by the report_congestion command might look slightly more optimistic than those reported by the route_global command because the tool rounds down the congestion information before saving it with the design. Use the following options to modify the default behavior: -rerun_global_router Use this option to rerun the global routing even if the block already has a congestion map. -boundary coordinates Use this option to restrict the reporting to a specific region of the block. -layers layers Use this option to restrict the reporting to specific layers. -mode global_route_cell_edge_based Use this option to report overflow information for each global routing cell. -include_soft_congestion_maps Use this option to output soft congestion reports, if they exist. A soft congestion report includes the demand from the soft nondefault spacing rules, as well as tool-generated soft rules.

An essential part of timing constraints are accurately specified clocks and clock effects, such as latency and uncertainty. When you specify clocks, the tool automatically constrains the paths between the registers driven by these clocks. However, you can change the default behavior of these timing paths by specifying timing exceptions such as paths that should not be analyzed (false paths), paths that require multiple clock cycles (multicycle paths), and so on. In addition, you can constrain the boundary timing paths by specifying input and output delays for input and output ports. The Fusion Compiler tool uses on-chip variation (OCV) mode to perform timing analysis, which models the effects of variation in operating conditions across the chip. This mode performs a conservative timing analysis that allows both minimum and maximum delays to apply to different paths at the same time. For a setup check, it uses maximum delays for the launch clock path and data path and minimum delays for the capture clock path. For a hold check, it uses minimum delays for the launch clock path and data path and maximum delays for the capture clock path. A block might operate under several different conditions, such as different temperatures and voltages, and might operate in several different functional modes. For timing analysis, each set of conditions is represented by a corner and each functional mode is represented by a mode. A scenario is a combination of a corner and mode used to perform timing analysis and optimization. Before you start working with a block, you must define the modes, corners, and scenarios that are used for the block, as well as the delay calculation model and routing layers to use. The routing layer information you specify is used for RC estimation during timing analysis.

You should help the user to answer their question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I Validating the Taps and Finding Invalid Taps"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Taps are used to model the external voltage source environment in which the device under analysis operates; they are not part of the design itself, but can be thought of as virtual models of voltage sources. The locations of the ideal voltage sources and the ideal power supplies in the design are required to achieve accurate rail analysis results. To create a tap, use the create_taps command. You can create multiple taps by running multiple create_taps commands. To specify a name for the created tap, use the -name option. If the specified name is already present in the design, the tool issues a warning message, and replaces the original tap with the new one. When you create multiple taps by a single invocation of the create_taps command, all of the created taps are named by using the tap_name _NNN naming convention, where NNN is a unique integer identifier and tap_name is the string argument to the -name option. You can create taps in any of the following ways: Treating top-level PG pins as taps Use the -top_pg option when the block does not have physical pad or bump information available. Use the -supply_net option to explicitly associate a tap to the supply (either power or ground) net connected to the object from which the tap was defined. To implicitly associate a tap with the supply net, run the create_taps command without the -supply_net option. The following example creates taps for all the top-level supply pins. fc_shell> create_taps -supply_net VDD -top_pg Creating taps at absolute coordinates Use the -layer and -point options to create taps at the specified coordinates. If there is no supply net, supply pin, or via shape at the specified location, which means there is no conductive path to the supply network, the tap has no effect on rail analysis despite being present. If you define a tap in a location where a tap already exists, the tool issues a warning message and replaces the original tap with the new one. You must specify the supply net with which this tap is associated by using the -supply_net option. Note: When you use the -point option with the -of_objects option, the location is relative to the origin of the specified object. Otherwise, it is relative to the origin of the current top-level block. The following example creates a tap using absolute coordinates. The command checks whether the coordinate location touches any layout shape. fc_shell> create_taps -supply_net VDD \\ -layer 3 -point {100.0 200.0} Warning: Tap point (100.0, 200.0) on layer 3 for net VDD does not touch any polygon (RAIL-305) Using existing instances as taps To create taps on specified objects, use the create_taps -of_objects command. Each item in the object list can be a cell or a library cell, or a collection of cells and library cells. By default, the tool creates the taps on the power and ground pins of the objects. If you specify the -point option, the tool creates the taps at the specified physical location relative to the origin of each object. Use existing instances for creating taps when analyzing a top-level design where pad cells are instantiated physically. Use the -supply_net option to explicitly associate a tap to the supply (either power or ground) net connected to the object from which the tap was defined. To implicitly associate a tap with the supply net, run the create_taps command without the supply_net option. The following example creates taps for each instance of the some_pad_cell library cell. The tool creates one tap per instance on the metal1 layer at a location of {30.4 16.3} relative to the origin of the cell instance. fc_shell> create_taps -of_objects [get_lib_cell */some_pad_cell]\\ -layer metal1 -point {30.4 16.3} The following example creates taps on all power and ground pins of all cell instances that match the *power_pad_cell* pattern. fc_shell> create_taps -of_objects [get_cells -hier \\ *power_pad_cell*] Importing a tap file If you are working with a block that does not yet have pins defined, or if the location or design of the pad cells is not finalized, you can define tap locations, layer numbers, and supply nets in an ASCII file and then import it into the tool by using the create_taps -import command. The supported tap file format is as follows: net_name layer_number [X-coord Y-coord] Lines starting with semicolon (;) or pound (#) symbols are treated as comments. The x- coordinate and y-coordinate values are specified in microns. For example, fc_shell> exec cat tap_file VDD 3 500.000 500.000 VSS 5 500.000 500.000 fc_shell> create_taps -import tap_file Creating taps with packages A simple package RLC (resistance-inductance-capacitance) model provides a fixed set of electrical characteristics assigned to all power and ground pads. To use simple package RLC models for rail analysis, you need to specify the pad location file which defines the simple RLC model by using rail.pad_files application option. For a detailed description about simple package RLC models, see the related section in the RedHawk User Manual Note: Before creating taps with simple package RLC models, you must enable the RedHawk signoff license key using the rail.allow_redhawk_license_checkout application option."}]}

You must specify the name of the library cell to use for tap cell insertion ( -lib_cell option) and the maximum distance, in microns, between tap cells ( -distance option). For example, fc_shell> create_tap_cells -lib_cell myreflib/mytapcell -distance 30 Note: If the place.legalize.enable_pin_color_alignment_check application option is true (its default is false ), the command ensures that internal cell pins and metal of the tap cells align with a routing track of the appropriate color when inserting the tap cells and shifts the tap cells to avoid violating color alignment. To avoid signoff DRC errors due to this shifting, reduce the tap distance slightly when this application option is true By default, the create_tap_cells command inserts tap cells in every row for the entire block. The tool starts inserting the tap cells at the left edge of the row and uses the specified tap distance to determine the location of the subsequent tap cells. In addition, if a tap cell does not exist within the minimum tap distance (half the specified tap distance) from each row edge adjacent to the block's boundary, a hard macro, or a hard placement blockage, the tool inserts an additional tap cell. shows the default tap cell placement for a block that uses the every-row insertion pattern. Note that extra tap cells are added to the right of the hard macro to ensure that a tap cell exists within the minimum tap distance from the edge of the hard macro. Default Tap Cell Placement You can modify the following aspects of the default behavior: The library cell used for tap cell insertion on rows with a mirrored (MX) orientation Use the -mirrored_row_lib_cell option to specify the library cell to use for mirrored rows. The pattern used to insert the tap cells Use the -pattern option to specify one of the following tap cell insertion patterns: every_row (the default) This pattern inserts tap cells in every row. For this pattern, the tap distance specified with the -distance option should be approximately twice the maximum diffusion-to-tap value specified in the technology design rules. every_other_row This pattern inserts tap cells only in the odd-numbered rows. For this pattern, the tap distance specified with the -distance option should be approximately twice the maximum diffusion-to-tap value specified in the technology design rules. stagger This pattern inserts tap cells in every row with the tap cells in even rows offset by half the offset value ( -offset option) relative to the odd rows, which produces a checkerboard-like pattern. For this pattern, the tap distance specified with the -distance option should be approximately four times the maximum diffusion-to-tap value specified in the technology design rules. The offset from the left edge of the row Use the -offset option to shift the pattern startpoint to the right by the specified distance in microns. The handling of fixed cells By default, tap cells are inserted at the computed tap locations, regardless of whether a fixed cell occupies that location. Use the -skip_fixed_cells option to prevent the insertion of tap cells in locations occupied by fixed cells. By default, when you use this option, the command considers the fixed cell as a blockage and breaks the row at the fixed cell, which can result in a tap cell being inserted on each side of the fixed cell. To prevent tap cells from overlapping fixed cells without breaking the row, use the -preserve_distance_continuity option with the -skip_fixed_cells option. When you use both options, the command shifts the tap cell to avoid overlap with the fixed cell. The -preserve_distance_continuity option shifts only those tap cells whose computed tap location is occupied by an instance of one of the specified library cells. For example, the following command shifts tap cells whose computed tap location is occupied by a fixed instance of the mylib/cell1 library cell: fc_shell> create_tap_cells -lib_cell mylib/tap -distance 30 \\ -skip_fixed_cells -preserve_distance_continuity mylib/cell1 When you use the -skip_fixed_cells option, you can also specify the minimum horizontal spacing between the boundary and a corner tap cell that is above or below a blocked area by using the -min_horizontal_periphery_spacing option. This option specifies the minimum number of unit tiles between the boundary and an affected corner tap cell. shows how using this option affects the tap cell placement both with and without boundary cells. Tap Cell Boundary Row Spacing -min_horizontal_periphery_spac -min_horizontal_periphery_spac The addition of extra tap cells You can use one or both of the following methods to prevent the insertion of extra tap cells: Use the -row_end_tap_bypass option to specify that the boundary cells contain taps, so additional tap cells are not inserted at the boundary. Note that the command does not verify that the block has boundary cells or that the boundary cells actually contain taps. Use the -at_distance_only option to allow the insertion of tap cells only at the specified tap distance, half of the tap distance, or one fourth of the tap distance (for the stagger pattern only). Note that using this option can cause DRC violations. The regions in which to insert tap cells Use the -voltage area option to restrict the tap cell insertion to the specified voltage areas. The naming convention used to identify the inserted tap cell instances By default, the tool uses the following naming convention for inserted tap cells: tapfiller! library_cell_name number Use the -separator option to change the separator character from its default of \"!.\" To identify the tap cells inserted in a specific run, use the -prefix option to specify a prefix string. When you use this option, the tool uses the following naming convention: tapfiller! prefix library_cell_name number"}]}

The constrained cells are shown in red, while the unconstrained cells are shown in green. Fixing a Maximum Vertical Edge Length Violation Maximum Stacking for Small Filler Cells Rule The maximum stacking for small filler cells rule restricts the stacking height of small filler cells. To select this rule, use the -replacement_rule small_filler_stacking option with the replace_fillers_by_rules command. When you select this rule, you must specify The maximum stacking height To specify the maximum stacking height, use the -max_constraint_length option. The cells considered for the check To specify the small filler cells to consider for the check, use the -small_fillers option. The filler cells that can be used to replace the violating filler cells To specify the filler cells that can be used to replace the violating filler cells, use the -replacement_fillers option. If the vertical stacking of the small filler cells specified in the -small_fillers option exceeds the height specified in the -max_constraint_length option, the command replaces two or three consecutive filler cells adjacent to the violating cell with one of the large filler cells specified in the -replacement_fillers option. If it is not possible to replace the filler cells, the command reorders the filler cells to fix the violation. The command maintains the threshold voltage at the location of the violating filler cell; however, the threshold voltage at the location of non-violating filler cells might change. The command does not check for threshold voltage violations caused by these changes. For example, the following command identifies and fixes maximum stacking violations where the stacking height exceeds 10 um: fc_shell> replace_fillers_by_rules \\ -replacement_rule small_filler_stacking -max_constraint_length 10 \\ -small_fillers {FILL1 FILL2} -replacement_fillers {FILL3 FILL4} \\ The following figures illustrate the replacement and reordering techniques used to fix maximum stacking violations.

Fixing Maximum Stacking Violation by Reordering FILL1 vt1 FILL1 vt1 FILL2 vt1 10um FILL2 vt1 FILL3 vt1 FILL3 vt2 FILL2 vt2 FILL2 vt2 Maximum Vertical Edge Length Rule The maximum vertical edge length rule restricts the vertical length of a stack of certain filler cells and standard cells. To select this rule, use the -replacement_rule max_vertical_constraint option with the replace_fillers_by_rules command. When you select this rule, you must specify The maximum vertical length To specify the maximum vertical length, use the -max_constraint_length option. The cells considered for the check These cells are called constrained cells. To specify the constrained filler cells, use the -constraint_fillers option. By default, all standard cells are constrained. To exclude specific standard cells from consideration, use the -exception_cells option. To ignore the length violation when a constrained cell abuts an exception cell, use the -no_violation_along_exception_cells option. The filler cells that can be used to replace the violating filler cells These filler cells are called unconstrained cells ; they are not considered when measuring the stack height. To specify the filler cells that can be used to break a continuous edge of constrained cells, use the -non_constraint_fillers option. To specify the filler cells whose left side can be used to break a continuous edge of constrained cells, use the -non_constraint_left_fillers option. To specify the filler cells whose right side can be used to break a continuous edge of constrained cells, use the -non_constraint_right_fillers option. Note: Any filler cells that are not identified as constrained, unconstrained, or exception cells are considered constrained cells. For example, the following command identifies and fixes maximum vertical edge length violations where the vertical length exceeds 180 um: fc_shell> replace_fillers_by_rules \\ -replacement_rule max_vertical_constraint -max_constraint_length 180 \\ -constraint_fillers {DECAP8 DECAP4} -non_constraint_fillers {FILL1} \\ -exception_cells {BUF1 TAP1} shows the original stack, which violates this rule, and the resulting stack, which uses unconstrained filler cells to fix the violation. The constrained cells are shown in red, while the unconstrained cells are shown in green. Fixing a Maximum Vertical Edge Length Violation Tap Cell Spacing Rule The tap cell spacing rule restricts the distance between a target tap cell's oxide diffusion (OD) layer and the OD layers of its neighboring cells on the left and right sides. To select this rule, use the -replacement_rule od_tap_distance option with the replace_fillers_by_rules command. When you select this rule, you must specify The disallowed spacing range The spacing distance is specified as the number of sites. To specify the disallowed spacing range, use the -tap_distance_range option. The tap cells considered for the check These cells are called target cells. To specify the target tap cells, use the -tap_cells option. The tap cells used to replace the violating tap cells These cells are called replacement cells To specify the replacement tap cell for left-side violations, use the -left_violation_tap option. To specify the replacement tap cell for right-side violations, use the -right_violation_tap option. To specify the replacement tap cell for both-side violations, use the -both_violation_tap option. Note: The target and replacement tap cells must all have the same size. By default, the command measures the distance to the cells that abut the target tap cell. If the tap cells abut library cells that do not have an OD layer, use the -adjacent_non_od_cells option to specify these library cells. The command skips the specified non-OD cells and measures to distance from the target tap cell to the first neighbor with an OD layer. For example, the following command replaces tap cells named TAP that have a separation distance of three sites: fc_shell> replace_fillers_by_rules -replacement_rule od_tap_distance \\ -tap_cells {TAP} -tap_distance_range {3 3} \\ -left_violation_tap {TAPl} -right_violation_tap {TAPr} \\ -both_violation_tap {TAPb} shows the original row, which violates this rule, and the resulting row, which uses the replacement filler cells to fix the violations. The target filler cells are shown in red, while the replacement filler cells are shown in green. Fixing a Tap Cell Spacing Violation Random Filler Cell Replacement To randomly replace existing filler cells, use the -replacement_rule random option with the replace_fillers_by_rules command. When you select this rule, you must specify The filler cells to be replaced and their replacements The filler cells to be replaced are called target cells. To specify the target filler cells and their replacements, use the following syntax with the -random_replace option: { { target_cell refill_cell 1a refill_cell 1b...}}... } To ignore filler cells that have a physical_status attribute of fixed or locked, use the -skip_fixed_cells option with the replace_fillers_by_rules command. When the command finds one of the target cells, it replaces it by randomly selecting one of the replacement cells specified for that target cell. For example, the following command replaces FILL1 cells with one of FILL1a, FILL1b, or FILL1c and replaces FILL2 cells with one of FILL2a or FILL2b: fc_shell> replace_fillers_by_rules -replacement_rule random \\ -random_replace { {FILL1 {FILL1a FILL1b FILL1c}} {FILL2 {FILL2a FILL2b}} }"}]}

To specify the most critical power scenarios in your design, use the -leakage_scenario and -dynamic_scenario options. The tool uses the power scenarios you specify to generate the high-level summary of the power QoR in the QORsum report. If you do not specify these options, it uses the active power scenario with the highest total power for both the leakage and dynamic scenario for the power QoR summary. These settings are only used for the power QoR summary. The tool uses the power information of all active power scenarios to capture and report the detailed power information in the QORsum report. To specify the most critical clock name and clock scenario, use the -clock_name and -clock_scenario options. The tool uses the clock name and scenario you specify to generate the high-level summary of the clock QoR in the QORsum report. If you do not specify these options, the tool identifies the most critical clock and uses it for the clock QoR summary. These settings are only used for the clock QoR summary. The tool uses all clocks to generate the detailed clock QoR information in the QORsum report. To specify a name to identify the run in the QORsum report, use the -run_name option. By default, the tool names each run with a number, such as Run1, Run2, and so on. You can use this option to give a more meaningful name to each run. You can also specify the run name by using the -run_names option when you generate the QORsum report by using the compare_qor_data command in step. If you do so, the tool ignores the run name specify by the set_qor_data_options -run_name command. The following example specifies the leakage-power scenario, dynamic-power scenario, clock scenario, and the clock to use for the corresponding summary in the QORsum report: fc_shell> set_qor_data_options \\ -leakage_scenario S1 -dynamic_scenario S2 \\ -clock_scenario S3 -clock_name sys_clk 2. Collect the QoR data for your report by using the write_qor_data command. The write_qor_data command captures QoR data related to timing, power, runtime, and other metrics. You can run the write_qor_data command multiple times, at each stage of the design flow at which you want to capture QoR data. Use the -label and specify a value to indicate at which stage of the flow you are capturing the data. By default, the write_qor_data command captures data relevant to a placed and optimized design. You can specify the -report_group option with any of the five supported value ( unmapped mapped placed cts routed ) to tune the set of reports being captured, based on the state of the flow where you are capturing the data. For finer-grain control, use the -report_list option to explicitly specify each report you want to generate. The write_qor_data command captures a standard set of QoR data to disk from most of the common tool reports like the report_qor and report_power. If there is additional custom data to capture that is not part of the command collection, use the capture_qor_data command to capture fully custom QoR data or GUI layout images to include in the web-based QORsum report. This can be used to supplement the standard QoR data captured by the write_qor_data command, or to create fully custom QORsum reports. Related commands include define_qor_data_panel that lets you create a new panel in the QORsum report for viewing QoR data, and set_qor_data_metric_properties, that lets you customize the properties of any metric column in any QORsum report panel, so you can control things like the style of coloring, or the thresholds for coloring when comparing data. 3. Generate the QORsum report by using the compare_qor_data command. This command takes the data captured by one or more runs of the write_qor_data command and creates a web-based report for viewing and comparing those results. You must specify the location of the output of each of the write_qor_data runs from the previous step by using -run_locations option. Each path location corresponds to the run result that you want to compare. You can assign a specific name to identify the run in the QORsum report by using the -run_names option. If you do so, the tool ignores the run name specify by using the set_qor_data_options -run_name command. By default, the tool names each run by a number, such as run1, run2, and so on. You can specify the output directory by using the -output option. By default, the tool writes the report to a directory named compare_qor_data. To overwrite exiting output data, use the -force option. By default, the tool does not overwrite existing output data. 4. View the generated QORsum report by using the view_qor_data command.

When you perform design planning and power planning, you create a floorplan to determine the size of the design, create the boundary and core area, create site rows for the placement of standard cells, set up the I/O pads, and create a power plan. For more information about design planning and power planning, see the Fusion Compiler Design Planning User Guide 3. Perform placement and optimization. To perform placement and optimization, use the place_opt command. The place_opt command placement and optimization addresses and resolves timing closure for your design. This iterative process uses enhanced placement and synthesis technologies to generate legalized placement for leaf cells and an optimized design. You can supplement this functionality by optimizing for power, recovering area for placement, minimizing congestion, and minimizing timing and design rule violations. 4. Perform clock tree synthesis and optimization. To perform clock tree synthesis and optimization, use the clock_opt command. Fusion Compiler clock tree synthesis and embedded optimization solve complicated clock tree synthesis problems, such as blockage avoidance and the correlation between preroute and postroute data. Clock tree optimization improves both clock skew and clock insertion delay by performing buffer sizing, buffer relocation, gate sizing, gate relocation, level adjustment, reconfiguration, delay insertion, dummy load insertion, and balancing of interclock delays. For more information about clock tree synthesis and optimization, see Clock Tree Synthesis 5. Perform routing and postroute optimization, as described in Routing and Postroute Optimization The Fusion Compiler tool uses Zroute to perform global routing, track assignment, detail routing, topological optimization, and engineering change order (ECO) routing. To perform postroute optimization, use the route_opt command. For most designs, the default postroute optimization setup produces optimal results. If necessary, you can supplement this functionality by optimizing routing patterns and reducing crosstalk or by customizing the routing and postroute optimization functions for special needs. 6. Perform chip finishing and design for manufacturing tasks, as described in Chip Finishing and Design for Manufacturing The Fusion Compiler tool provides chip finishing and design for manufacturing and design for yield capabilities that you can apply throughout the various stages of the design flow to address process design issues encountered during chip manufacturing. 7.

When you define a routing guide, you must specify Its rectangular boundary To specify the boundary, use the -boundary option to specify the lower-left and upper- right corners of the rectangle using the following syntax: {{ llx lly } { urx ury }} Information specific to the purpose of the routing guide The following table describes the user-defined routing guides. Table 30 User-Defined Routing Guides Purpose Option -preferred_direction_only -switch_preferred_direction -max_patterns -horizontal_track_utilization -vertical_track_utilization Purpose Option -access_preference -river_routing By default, the tool creates a routing guide named RD# in the current block, where is a unique integer. Use the following options to change the default behavior: To specify a name for the routing guide, use the -name option. To specify the routing layers affected by the routing guide, use the -layers option. Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. To create the routing guide in a different physical cell, use the -cell option. When you use this option, the tool creates the routing guide in the cell's reference block using the coordinate system of the cell's top-level block.

This ensures that the tool uses accurate clock-gate latencies during datapath optimization and useful-skew optimization performed before clock tree synthesis, when clocks are ideal. If you plan to perform structural multisource clock tree synthesis for your design, ensure that the tool estimates clock-gate latencies that are appropriate for structural multisource clock subtrees by setting the opt.clock_latency_estimation.estimate_smscts_subtrees application option to true To improve the accuracy of the estimated clock-gate latencies, specify clock tree synthesis settings before you run the compile_fusion command. Such settings include the clock tree buffer library cell list, the clock tree inverter library cell list, and clock nondefault routing rules. Estimated clock latencies are more accurate than user-specified clock latencies. In addition, the tool updates the estimated clock latencies after steps such as placement and multibit banking, while user-specified latencies are static values. To prevent the tool from estimating the latency for a specific clock gate, set the dont_estimate_clock_latency attribute on its clock pin by using the set_attribute command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> set_attribute \\ [get_pins {ICG21/CK}] dont_estimate_clock_latency true For best results, do not use the following features with integrated clock-gate latency estimation: Trial clock tree synthesis To disable this feature, set the compile.flow.trial_clock_tree application option to false Clock-gate optimization To disable this feature, set the compile.flow.optimize_icgs application option to false Placement-aware clock gating The tool automatically disables this feature when clock-gate latency estimation is enabled regardless of the compile.clockgate.physically_aware application option setting. User-specified latencies User-specified latencies are set by the set_clock_latency set_clock_gate_latency set_clock_gating_check -setup, or set_path_margin -setup commands. The tool does not modify any set_clock_latency constraints that you specify on clock- gating cells. Tool-estimated clock-gate latency values are stored as offsets from the user- specified values. You can see the offset values by using the write_script -format icc2 command and checking for the set_clock_latency -offset commands in the generated output. If you do not set any latency values, the reported offsets are equal to the estimated latency values. The estimated latency offset values are not captured in an SDC file generated by the write_sdc command. Latency estimates are most accurate if the relative locations of the clock gates and their gated registers do not change during clock tree synthesis. To preserve the placement of integrated clock gates, enable the automatic relocation of clock network cells by setting the cts.compile.enable_cell_relocation application option to auto before clock tree synthesis."}]}

If your design does not already have these connections, use the connect_pg_net command to create them. This command creates the logical power and ground connections for leaf cells, hierarchical cells, and physical-only cells in both single- voltage and multivoltage designs. Before creating the logical power and ground connections, you must resolve any PG conflicts among the netlist, floorplan, and UPF specification. For multivoltage designs, the conflicts are resolved when you commit the power intent, as described in Loading and Applying UPF Information For single-voltage designs, you must run the resolve_pg_netx command to resolve the conflicts. Note that the UPF specification for a single-voltage design is the default power domain generated by the read_verilog command. If your design contains unmapped instances, the tool issues an information message to indicate that only mapped instances are connected. The connect_pg_net command operates in two modes: Automatic In automatic mode, the command derives all power and ground nets, power and ground pins, tie-off pins, and connections from the UPF specification. If the supply nets do not exist, the tool creates them. To create the logical power and ground connections in automatic mode, use the -automatic option with the connect_pg_net command. Manual In manual mode, the command makes the connections that you specify. If a specified pin or port has an existing connection, the tool removes the existing connection and then creates the specified connection. The tool verifies that the connections match the power intent. If it finds a mismatch, the tool issues a warning but still creates the connection. To create logical power and ground connections in manual mode, use the -net option to specify the power or ground net and specify the pins and ports to be connected to that net as an argument to the command. For example, to connect the VDD power net to all pins named vdd and the VSS ground net to all pins named vss, use the following commands: fc_shell> connect_pg_net -net VDD [get_pins */vdd] fc_shell> connect_pg_net -net VSS [get_pins */vss] To connect PG nets to power and ground pins only, use the -pg option. To connect PG nets to tie-off pins only, use the -tie option. By default, if neither option is specified, the tool makes connections to all power, ground, and tie-off pins. These options cannot be used with an object list or with the -create_nets_only and -net options. Regardless of the command options used, the tool always creates connections required to build a complete PG netlist structure, such as top-level PG ports and intermediate hierarchical PG pins."}]}

For more information about preparing input files, see Preparing Design and Input Data for Rail Analysis Voltage drop analysis is supported in both RedHawk Fusion and RedHawk-SC Fusion analysis flows. To invoke the RedHawk/RedHawk-SC tool for calculating voltage drops of the specified power and ground networks, use the analyze_rail command with the following options: Use the -voltage_drop option to specify the analysis mode. static : Performs static voltage drop analysis. dynamic : Performs dynamic voltage drop analysis. dynamic_vectorless : Performs dynamic voltage drop analysis without Verilog Change Dump (VCD) inputs. dynamic_vcd : Performs dynamic voltage drop analysis with VCD inputs. When enabled, use the -switching_activity option to specify a switching activity file. Use the -nets option to specify the power and ground supply nets to analyze. The tool considers all the switched or internal power nets of the specified power nets in the analysis. You do not need to explicitly specify the internal power nets. (Optional) Use the -switching_activity option to specify a switching activity file. The supported file formats are: VCD SAIF, and ICC_ACTIVITY. When not specified, by default the tool uses the toggle rate for rail analysis. Note: If you are using the dynamic vector-free mode, you do not need to provide switching activity information. To specify a switching activity file, use the -switching_activity option by using the following syntax: -switching_activity { type file_name strip_path ] [ start_time end_time ]} VCD : Specifies a VCD file that is generated from a gate-level simulation. By default, rail analysis reads and uses all time values in the VCD file. To specify the time window to read from the VCD file, use the optional start_time and end_time arguments with the -switching_activity option. When specified, the tool reads all time values from the VCD file, but uses only the specified time window for rail analysis. SAIF : Specifies one or more SAIF files generated from a gate-level simulation. icc_activity : Runs the Fusion Compiler write_saif command to generate a SAIF file that contains the user-annotated and simulated switching activity (including state-dependent and path-dependent information) for the complete design without running the propagation engine. The strip_path argument removes the specified string from the beginning of the object names. Using this option modifies the object names in the VCD or SAIF file to make them compatible with the object names in the block. The strip_path argument is case- sensitive.

(Optional) By default, the analyze_rail command automatically generates a GSR file for running RedHawk rail analysis. To specify an external GSR file to append to the GSR file generated in the current run, use the -extra_gsr_option_file option. (Optional) Use the -redhawk_script_file option to specify an existing RedHawk script file generated in an earlier analyze_rail run. When using an existing script file for rail analysis, the tool honors the settings in this file and ignores all other currently enabled options. For example, if you run the analyze_rail -voltage_drop static -redhawk_script_file myscript.tcl command, the tool ignores the -voltage_drop option setting. When the -redhawk_script_file option is not specified, you must specify the nets to analyze by using the -nets option.

To create a rectangular routing blockage, use the -boundary option to specify the lower-left and upper-right corners of the rectangle using the following syntax: { { llx lly } { urx ury } } To create a rectilinear routing blockage, use the -boundary option to specify the coordinates of the polygon using the following syntax: { { x1 y1 } { x2 y2 }... } You can also create a rectilinear routing blockage by specifying the polygon as the combined area of a heterogeneous collection of objects with physical geometry, such as poly_rects, geo_masks, shapes, layers, and other physical objects. If you specify a layer, the resulting area includes the area of every shape on the layer. For all other objects, the resulting area includes the area of each object. You can create multiple routing blockages by specifying the boundary polygon as a geo_mask or a collection of physical objects.

To specify the affected layers, use the -layers option. Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. The layers can be metal, via, or poly layers. By default, the tool creates a routing blockage named RB_ objId in the current block that prevents routing of all nets within the routing blockage boundary.

For example, to use layers M2 through M7 for routing, RC estimation, and congestion analysis, use the following command: fc_shell> set_ignored_layers \\ -min_routing_layer M2 -max_routing_layer M7 To allow the use of layers beyond the minimum or maximum routing layer only for pin connections, set the route.common.global_min_layer_mode and route.common.global_max_layer_mode application options to allow_pin_connection To change the constraints to hard constraints, set the route.common.global_min_layer_mode and route.common.global_max_layer_mode application options to hard To specify additional layers to be ignored for RC estimation and congestion analysis, use the -rc_congestion_ignored_layers option. The specified layers must be between the minimum and maximum routing layers. For example, to use layers M2 through M7 for routing and layers M3 through M7 for RC estimation and congestion analysis, use the following command: fc_shell> set_ignored_layers \\ -min_routing_layer M2 -max_routing_layer M7 \\ -rc_congestion_ignored_layers {M2} To change an existing layer constraint setting, simply reset that option. When you reset an option, it overrides the existing value of only that option; the other option settings remain unchanged. For example, assume that you used the previous command to set the minimum routing layer to M2 and the maximum routing layer to M7. To change the maximum routing layer from M7 to M8, but keep the other settings, use the following command: fc_shell> set_ignored_layers -max_routing_layer M8"}]}

You can use this flow to fix timing and DRC violations and improve area and power QoR at the very late stages of the implementation flow. The Fusion Compiler ECO Fusion flow consists of the following steps: 1. Specify the settings required to run the PrimeTime ECO capabilities within the Fusion Compiler tool by using the set_pt_options command. The following example specifies the path to the PrimeTime executable and the settings for distributed processing: fc_shell> set_host_options -name pteco_host_option \\ -submit_command \"/lsf/bin/bsub -R \\\"rusage\\[mem=$MEM\\]\\\"\" fc_shell> set_pt_options -pt_exec /snps_tools/PT/pt_shell \\ -host_option pteco_host_option If there is a.synopsys_pt.setup file in the current working directory, the Fusion Compiler tool uses the information in this file. However, you can specify additional PrimeTime settings by using the -pre_link_script and -post_link_script options of the set_pt_options command. For more information, see the man page for the set_pt_options command. 2. Set up StarRC extraction as follows: a. Ensure that StarRC extraction is enabled. StarRC extraction is controlled by the extract.starrc_mode application option. The default is fusion_adv. You can also set the value to in-design or none To use the native extractor, set the value to none b. Specify a configuration file for running StarRC extraction by using the set_starrc_options -config command. 3. Perform optimization by using the eco_opt command. By default, the eco_opt command fixes timing (setup and hold) and DRC violations, removes redundant buffers, and improves the total power QoR by using PrimeTime ECO capabilities. It then incorporates the ECO changes by using the Fusion Compiler ECO place and route capabilities. However, you can control the type of optimization by using the -type option. The following example uses the eco_opt command to fix only timing and DRC violations using exhaustive path-based analysis: fc_shell> eco_opt -pba_mode exhaustive -types {timing drc} The following example uses the eco_opt command to improve the leakage power QoR. However, it does not incorporate the ECO changes. Instead, it generates a file containing the ECO changes. fc_shell> eco_opt -pba_mode exhaustive -types {timing drc} \\ -write_change_file_only For more information, see the man page for the eco_opt command. 4. Analyze the PrimeTime QoR by using the check_pt_qor command. For more information, see the man page for the check_pt_qor command. Note: When you run the eco_opt command, the Fusion Compiler tool specifies the PrimeTime settings based on the Fusion Compiler timing analysis settings, such as derating factors, on-chip-variation settings, and so on. Therefore, for optimal convergence, ensure that the Fusion Compiler timing analysis settings at the postroute stage are consistent with the PrimeTime timing analysis settings. You can identify the differences in the Fusion Compiler and PrimeTime settings by using the check_consistency_settings command."}]}

To perform wire widening, use the widen_zrt_wires comandcomandswiden_zrt_wireswire widening widen_wires command. By default, the widen_wires command widens all wires in the block to 1.5 times their original width. For more flexibility, you can use the -widen_widths_by_layer_name option to define up to five possible wire widths to use for each layer. For example, to define possible wire widths of 0.07 and 0.06 microns for the M1 layer; wire widths of 0.08 and 0.07 microns for the M2 layer; and 1.5 times the existing wire width for all other layers, enter the following command: fc_shell> widen_wires \\ -widen_widths_by_layer_name {{M1 0.07 0.06} {M2 0.08 0.07}} When you perform wire widening, the spacing between neighboring wires is decreased, which can reduce the improvement in critical area shorts gained from wire spreading. You can control the tradeoff between wire spreading and wire widening by using the -spreading_widening_relative_weight option. By default, wire spreading and wire widening are given equal priority. To weight the priority toward wire widening and reduced critical area open faults, set this option to a value between 0.0 and 0.5. To weight the priority toward wire spreading and reduced critical area short faults, set this option to a value between 0.5 and 1.0. After widening, the widen_wires command performs detail routing iterations to fix any DRC violations caused as a result of widening. Note that the widened wires do not trigger fat wire spacing rules. When you widen the wires, it changes the timing of your block. Wire widening has a timing-preservation mode that allows you to perform wire widening without affecting the block timing. To enable timing-preservation mode for wire widening, define the timing preservation constraints by using the following options with the widen_wires command: -timing_preserve_setup_slack_threshold threshold -timing_preserve_hold_slack_threshold threshold -timing_preserve_nets nets The threshold values are floating-point numbers in library units. Wire widening is not performed on nets with slack less than the specified values or the nets specified in the -timing_preserve_nets option."}]}

This and other summary views help you sort and filter the data to pinpoint the runs you want to explore further. Detailed table panels provide deeper insight into your data than can be found on the summary tables. For example, a summary table might give a high-level overview of design timing (WNS, TNS, NVE) at each major stage in the flow. A detailed table might show more in-depth path-group based timing information, showing the timing numbers for each separate scenario and path group in the design. This is only one example. There are many detailed table panels in the QORsum report, that shows information like statistics about each library cell instantiated in the design (number of instances, type of cell, total, area), or information about how much wirelength is on each routed metal layer. A detailed table lets you view this information for up to six different datasets at once. A dataset is a set of data captured for a specific run and stage/label in the flow. For example, you might view the route_opt command results for three different runs at once. Or you might view one run, but looking at the progression of results across different stages in the design flow (place_opt, clock_opt, route_opt), as shown in the following figure. Path Group Details The flows are shown side by side as columns under each metric. For example, the WNS column group (and the column group of each metric) shows the same six columns labeled 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10. These columns represent the results of each flow, and are given a flow ID number, rather than showing the full flow name, to prevent the columns from being too wide. The first column under each metric is the baseline, and the other five are the test flows being compared to that baseline. A legend is shown above the table with the flow ID number in a gold box (for the baseline) or a blue box (for the test flows), followed by the flow name. You can expand or collapse the legend by clicking the Legend button. You can also see the flow ID numbers in the \"Choose Baseline and Visible Runs\" dialog box, which is opened by clicking the Runs button. The detailed table views can display up to six runs at one time (your baseline run, plus the first five other runs selected in the Choose Baseline and Visible Runs dialog box). To change the runs that are displayed, 1. Click the Runs button to open the Choose Baseline and Visible Runs dialog box. 2. From the Visible Runs (Summary) column, select or deselect the runs accordingly. This selects and deselects those runs from the Visible flows (Detailed) column. Because a detailed table may show hundreds or even thousands of lines of data, it is not possible to view more than six datasets at a time. But if you want to see more details about these metrics across all runs and all flow stages/labels loaded into the QORsum report, there is an alternate view that shows this. This is called the Focused View. It can be accessed either by clicking the Focused View toggle button at the top of the report (see focused view, you can see the results for all runs and all flow stages for a specific row of data from a detailed table. For example, in a path-group based timing detailed table, you might want to focus on the information only for path_group1 in scenarioA. To see this, click on the row in the detailed table for that path group and scenario. The Focused View for it opens. Using the same path-group timing example, the focused view shows one path group at a time. You can change the focus to a different path group by selecting a different scenario or path group name in the drop-down menus at the top of the report. See Focused View Drop-down Menu Filtering the Detailed Data Detailed views offer filters to focus on specific data. Some views have default filters that are shown automatically. For example, the following detailed views have default scenario and path group filters: Path Type Details, Path Group Details, and Logic Level Details. You can modify the default filters by Removing the filter by clicking the X symbol before the filter name Changing the filter value Enable and disable the filter by clicking anywhere on the filter but the X symbol or value field You can also apply custom filters to the detailed data. To create a custom filter, 1. Click the Filter button to display the Add Filter fields, which are shown in the following figure: 2. Define the filter by defining the filter criteria and selecting the datasets to include in the results. To define the filter, select the column and comparison type, and then specify the comparison value. To perform a numeric comparison, select one of the following comparison types:!= <=, or >= and specify a numeric value in the Value field. To perform a string comparison, select the contains comparison type and specify a string value in the Value field. To perform a regular expression comparison, select the regexp comparison type and specify a regular expression in the Value field. To filter based on the available values of the selected column, select the enum comparison type, which populates the Value field with a drop-down menu that contains the available values, and then enable one or more of the displayed values. When a value is enabled, a check mark is displayed before the value. To enable or disable a value, highlight the value by clicking it or navigating to it by using the Up and Down arrows, and then press Enter, which toggles the value status. You can also type a string in the Value field to filter the available values in the drop-down menu. To dismiss selected values, click the X symbol. 3. Apply the filter by clicking the green check mark.

Before you create the abstract view, ensure that the scenarios needed at the top level have been created and are active. To create an abstract view for top-level closure, use the create_abstract command. To control the amount of timing information in the abstract view, use the -timing_level option with the following settings: To create an abstract that contains only the boundary cells (one level of logic) connected to each boundary port, use the boundary setting. Such an abstract also contains feedthrough data paths, feedthrough combinational clock paths, and internal clock logic driving output ports. You can use this type of abstract to fix DRC violations at the top level. To create a compact abstract that contains the timing information for only the critical setup and hold timings paths of the interface logic, use the compact setting. This is the default setting, and is preferred for top-level design closure. To create an abstract with timing information for all the interface logic, use the full_interface setting. A full_interface abstract might be required for multiply-instantiated blocks (MIBs) when the constraints for MIB instances are different at the top-level. To create the abstracts for lower-level blocks of the current block, use one of the following methods: Create abstracts for specific lower-level blocks by using the -blocks option and specify the names of the blocks. Create abstracts for all lower-level blocks by using the -all_blocks option. When you use the -blocks or -all_blocks option, if a specified block has an abstract view, by default, the tool does not re-create it. To force the tool to re-create the abstract, use the -force_recreate option. To include specific nets, ports, hierarchical pins, or leaf pins in a placement or timing abstract, use the -include_objects option. To create a read-only abstract, use the -read_only option. By default, the tool creates an editable abstract that you can modify in the context of a parent block. However, the tool makes the design view of the block read-only, preventing any changes from being made to the block. When you create the abstract view as read-only, the design view of the block is editable, and you can make changes to it. To flatten the physical hierarchy and retain only the relevant logic of the lower-level blocks, use the -preserve_block_instances false option. To specify if the abstract is going to be used for design planning or top-level implementation, use the -target_use planning or -target_use implementation option. Based on the intended usage, the tool applies appropriate internal settings to the abstract. To specify host options for distributed processing, use -host_options option and specify the appropriate settings.

You should help the user to answer their question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I Comparing Libraries"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To identify redundancies, outliers, equivalences, and gaps in cell families, perform the following steps: 1. Create a collection of the libraries you want to analyze, which is known as a libset, by using the create_libset command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_libset -name myLibset -libs {abcd1 abcd2} When you perform library analysis, you can specify the libset name, instead of specifying a list of libraries. In addition, the tool uses the libset name, instead of using a list of the library names, when it generates reports, plots, and so on during analysis. You can include a cell library in more then one libset. 2. Set up the library analysis environment by using the create_environment command. The create_environment command associates a predefined libset with a process label, process number, voltage, and temperature, which is then used for analyzing the libraries. You can specify the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature of the analysis environment by using one of the following methods: Specify the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature values by using the -ppvt option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env1 -libset myLibset \\ -ppvt {{SS1p, 1.0, 0.6, 125}} Specify a predefined operating condition from the reference library by using the -op_conds option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env2 -libset myLibset \\ -op_conds SS1p6125 Specify corners from which to infer the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature values by using the -corners option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env3 -libset myLibset \\ -corners nworst Specify that the tool infers the process label, process number, voltage, and temperature values from the scenario and UPF associated with the current design by using the -auto_infer_design option, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_environment -name env4 -libset myLibset \\ -auto_infer_design 3. (Optional) Specify a naming convention for library cells and perform lexical classification by using lexical attributes. A library cell naming convention can help the tool identify cell families in the subsequent steps of the flow. For example, assume a cell in your library is named AND2D4WSULVT. This name is the concatenation of the AND2, D4, WS, and ULVT string, which represent cell characteristics that are associated to a lexical attribute, as shown in the following table: Table 2 Lexical Attributes for the Naming Convention of an Example Library Column Lexical Attribute Allowed Pattern Values for Example Cell lexical_cell_prefix_name Column Lexical Attribute Allowed Pattern Values for Example Cell lexical_drive1_name lexical_well_substrate_bias_arch itecure lexical_device_threshold_voltage You can specify the naming convention for this library by using the set_lib_cell_naming_convention command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 1 -pattern {[a-zA-Z0-9]*} -attribute \"lexical_cell_prefix_name\" fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 2 -pattern {D[0-9]*} -attribute \"lexical_drive1_name\" fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 3 -pattern {WS} -attribute \"lexical_well_substrate_bias_architecure\" fc_shell> set_lib_cell_naming_convention -library $lib \\ -column 4 -pattern {ULVT|SVT|LVT|MVT} -attribute \"lexical_device_threshold_voltage\" Note: For a list of all the predefined lexical attributes, see the man page for the set_lib_cell_naming_convention command. After you specify the naming convention, perform lexical classification by using the classify_lib_cell_attributes command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> classify_lib_cell_attributes -libset myLibset To report the lexical classification results, use the report_lib_cell_classification_attributes command. To report the library cells which are not lexical classified under the given naming convention, use the report_lexical_unclassified_lib_cells command. If there are lexically unclassified cells, specify additional naming conventions and rerun lexical classification. 4. (Optional) Exclude specific cells from library analysis by using the set_use_for_library_analysis command. By default, the tool excludes physical-only cells during library analysis. However, you can exclude additional cells, such as library cells with a dont_use setting, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> set exclude_cells [filter_collection [get_lib_cells $libs/*] \"dont_use == true\"] fc_shell> set_use_for_library_analysis $exclude_cells false To report the cells that are excluded, use the report_lexical_ignored_lib_cells command. 5. Identify all library cell families by using the identify_lib_cell_families command. To report the tool-identified library cell families, use the report_lib_cell_families -all_initial command. To manually define library cell families, use the define_lib_cell_family command. To report these user-defined cell families, use the report_lib_cell_families -all_userdef command. 6. Analyze the libraries by using the run_library_analysis command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> run_library_analysis -name myLibset_run1 -environment env1 The name of the environment you specify with the -environment option must correspond to an environment you previously created by using the create_environment command. 7. Identify redundancies in library cell families by using the find_library_redundancies command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> find_library_redundancies -analysis myLibset_run1 The name of the analysis you specify with the -analysis option must correspond to the name of an analysis you previously performed by using the run_library_analysis command. In addition to redundant cells, the find_library_redundancies command also identifies outlier and equivalent cells in library families. 8. Identify gaps in library cell families by using the find_library_gaps command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> find_library_gaps -analysis myLibset_run1 The name of the analysis you specify with the -analysis option must correspond to the name of an analysis you previously performed by using the run_library_analysis command. 9. Report the library cell gaps, redundancies, outliers, and equivalence identified during library analysis by using the report_library_analysis command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> report_library_analysis -analysis myLibset_run1 \\ -analysis_type redundancy -detail fc_shell> report_library_analysis -analysis myLibset_run1 \\ -analysis_type outlier -detail fc_shell> report_library_analysis -analysis myLibset_run1 \\ -analysis_type equivalent -detail fc_shell> report_library_analysis -analysis myLibset_run1 \\ -analysis_type gap -detail 10. Generate plots by using the gui_plot_lib_cells_attributes command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> gui_plot_lib_cells_attributes -libset myLibset \\ -lib_cell_type all -x_attrib_name leakage -y_attrib_name avgsl_fall_delay \\ -chart_type scatter"}]}

These drivers are in turn driven by global clock distribution structure such as a clock mesh and H-tree. The local subtrees of a structural multisource clock tree are optimized by clock cell merging, splitting, sizing, and relocation, while preserving the levels of the user-defined clock tree structure. To implement a structural multisource clock tree, perform the following steps: 1. Specify your clock tree constraints and settings. 2. For multivoltage designs, Enable multivoltage support by using the following application option setting: fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name cts.multisource.enable_full_mv_support -value true Enable the addition of physical feedthrough cells, which belong to a voltage area physically but not logically, by using the following application option setting: fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name opt.common.allow_physical_feedthrough -value true Run the check_mv_design command and fix all multivoltage issues 3. Enable cell electromigration fixing by setting the cts.multisource.cell_em_aware application option to true 4. Create the clock mesh by using the create_clock_straps command, as described in Creating Clock Straps 5. Insert the mesh drivers by using the create_clock_drivers command, as described in Inserting Clock Drivers 6. Build the global clock tree structure by using the synthesize_multisource_global_clock_trees command, as described in Synthesizing the Global Clock Trees 7.

Therefore the clock mesh can only be analyzed after you complete those steps. However, to prevent the tool from seeing a very large delay through the clock mesh when synthesizing the local subtrees, annotate a realistic delay and transition value on the clock mesh net. 8. Build the local subtrees by using the synthesize_multisource_clock_subtrees command, as described in Building the Local Clock Subtree Structures 9.

Before you run Custom Router to perform routing on a DDR design, Group the nets as a bundle for length matching. fc_shell> create_bundle -name GRP1 [get_nets $nets] Create and apply the routing rules for the DDR nets. fc_shell> create_routing_rule DDR -widths { layer value \u2026} \\ -spacings { layer value \u2026 } fc_shell> set_routing_rule -rule DDR -min_routing_layer M4 \\ -max_routing_layer M5 $all_ddr_nets Set two or more layers for initial routing and length matching. For postroute length matching, you should include two additional layers. For example, if you use the M4 and M5 layers for initial routing, set the M3, M4, M5, and M6 layers for postroute length matching. Add routing blockages as needed. Add routing blockages to prevent Custom Router from routing in the area that is covered by placement blockages. This helps avoid possible unplaceable buffers during buffer insertion. 2. Create routes for the DDR nets by running the route_custom command. fc_shell> route_custom -nets $all_ddr_nets 3. Define the routing constraints. Use the following application options to set the single-loop constraints. fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name custom.route.single_loop_match -value true fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name custom.route.single_loop_match_min_spacing -value 0.75 fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name custom.route.single_loop_match_max_spacing -value 10.0 fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name custom.route.single_loop_match_offset_layer -value true Set the wire matching constraint for the group. fc_shell> create_wire_matching -for [get_bundles GRP1] \\ -match_type length -tolerance 20 -force match1 fc_shell> create_wire_matching -for [get_bundles GRP2] \\ -match_type length -tolerance 20 -force match2 Set the bounding box for the wire matching routing constraint. fc_shell> set_app_options -name custom.route.match_box \\ -value {{1000 1000} {1500 1500}} By default, the bounding box coordinates are set to {{0 0} {0 0}}. When set to other values, the router limits matching routes to the area inside the box, which might result in connections that do not meet the matching constraint. The matching box should cover the entire available channel space. 4. Perform custom routing with length matching. fc_shell> route_custom -nets [get_bundles {GRP1}] If you define multiple matching boxes at step 3, you need to run the route_custom command on each matching box. 5. Report the list of mismatching nets. grep \"Mismatch\" log_file 6. Reduce the number of the mismatched nets (if any) by using one of the following methods: Rebalance the net routing of one or more groups in the same channel among the available routing layers by a. Resetting the routing layers. For example, - Set the routing layers for route group A to the M3 and M4 layers, and for group B to the M5 and M6 layers, or - Set the routing layers for route groups A and B to the M3 and M4 layers, and route all mismatched nets on the M5 and M6 layers. b. Rerunning initial routing with the rebalanced routing layer settings. Set a larger value for the custom.route single_loop_match_max_spacing application option. Allow different layers for the single loop. fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name custom.route.single_loop_match_offset_layer -value true 7. Insert buffer cells on the routed DDR net. In the following example, ddr_BUF is used as the prefix for the names of the added ECO nets and buffers for easy identification. The buffer cells are added at an interval that is 20 percent of the total net length. fc_shell> set ddr_buf \"BUF001\" fc_shell> add_buffer_on_route -net_prefix ddr_BUF \\ -cell_prefix ddr_BUF \\ -repeater_distance_length_ratio 0.2 \\ -respect_blockages [get_nets $ddr_nets] $ddr_BUF 8. Perform legalization and verify that the placement is legal. fc_shell> legalize_placement -cells $ddr_BUF fc_shell> check_legality -cells $ddr_BUF Note: Using the -cells option with the legalize_placement and check_legality commands is supported only in the standard legalizer. 9. Preserve the route shapes of the clock nets by setting the shape_use attribute of the clock nets to user_route fc_shell> set_attribute [get_shapes -of_object $all_nets] \\ shape_use \"user_route\" fc_shell> set_attribute [get_vias -of_object $all_nets] \\ shape_use \"user_route\" 10. Limit rerouting to minor changes by setting the physical_status attribute on the nets to minor_change fc_shell> set_attribute [get_shapes -of_object $all_nets] \\ physical_status \"minor_change\" fc_shell> set_attribute [get_vias -of_object $all_nets] \\ physical_status \"minor_change\" 11. Run ECO routing to reconnect the nets by using the route_eco command. fc_shell> route_eco -nets $all_nets -reroute modified_nets_only 12. Run incremental detail routing to fix the DRC violations by running the route_detail -incremental true command. After routing is complete, clean up the routed nets by running the remove_redundant_shapes command. fc_shell> set_attribute \\ [get_shapes -of_object $all_nets] shape_use \"detail_route\" fc_shell> set_attribute \\ [get_vias -of_object $all_nets] shape_use \"detail_route\" fc_shell> route_detail -incremental true fc_shell> remove_redundant_shapes -nets $all_nets 13. Check the routing results by using one of the following methods: Check for DRC violations. fc_shell> check_routes By default, the tool checks for DRC violations between signal shapes. To check for DRC violations between signal shapes and user shapes, use the following command: fc_shell> check_routes -check_from_user_shapes true View the ECO nets and buffers in the GUI.

The Fusion Compiler tool can analyze all clock gates and insert additional clock gates to take advantage of shared enable signals. Inserting additional clock gates might improve power, area, or other metrics, depending on the design. If six or more clock gates share an enable signal, the tool inserts an additional level of clock gates. The new clock gates are then considered for further level expansion. As a result, the tool might insert multiple levels of clock gates during this operation. To allow the tool to expand the number of clock-gate levels, set the compile.clockgate.enable_level_expansion application option to true (the default is false ) and set the compile.clockgate.max_number_of_levels application option to a nonzero value (the default is 0). In this case, the tool adds clock gates until either of the following conditions is met: All common enable signals are identified and used for multilevel clock-gate expansion. The user-specified maximum number of clock-gate levels is reached. The tool names a newly-inserted clock gate as follows, based on the status of the set of clock gates whose enable functions are modified by the new clock gate: If at least one of the clock gates is a tool-inserted clock gate, the base name is clock_gate_ml. The name is appended with the register base name, similar to the naming convention for other tool-inserted clock gates. If all of the clock gates are preexisting clock gates, the tool uses the name of the preexisting clock gate with the largest fanout and appends _ml_pe The compile.clockgate.max_number_of_levels application option specifies the maximum number of allowed clock-gate levels. The default is 0, which allows an infinite number of levels. However, to use the clock-gate level expansion capability, you must set this application option to a nonzero value (in addition to setting the compile.clockgate.enable_level_expansion application option to true ). If you specify clock-gate level expansion, but the maximum number of allowed levels is low, the expansion operation cannot take full advantage of the tool's ability to analyze common enable signals. To enable or disable clock-gate level expansion for specific clock gates, use the set_clock_gate_transformations -expand_levels command. The following usage notes apply: New clock gates inherit the constraints set by the set_clock_gate_transformations set_clock_gate_style set_dont_touch set_size_only set_lib_cell_purpose and set_boundary_optimization commands. Clock-gate latency estimations are updated after the insertion operation. When the insertion operation modifies the enable signal of a clock gate, the gate retains its original designation of being either preexisting or tool-inserted. Self-gating is restricted from adding another clock-gate level if the maximum number of levels is already reached. Integrated clock gates inside multibit cells are counted as part of the clock-gate level count. However, they are not candidates for clock-gate level expansion. New clock gates do not inherit timing exceptions."}]}

To verify the legality of the design, use the check_legality command. To verify the routing, use the check_routes command. To perform postroute logic optimization, 1. Update the clock latency by using the compute_clock_latency command. 2. Run the route_opt command two times. The legalization and ECO routing performed by the first route_opt run might impact the block timing, which is then optimized by the second route_opt run. As the number of changes during postroute logic optimization decreases, the timing improvement from subsequent route_opt runs decreases. The route_opt command performs the following tasks: 1. Performs extraction and updates the timing By default, the route_opt command uses the PrimeTime delay calculation engine, which requires that you use cell libraries generated by O-2018.06 or later versions of the Library Manager tool. Before using PrimeTime delay calculation, use the check_consistency_settings command to verify that the Fusion Compiler and PrimeTime settings are consistent, as described in Checking for Consistency in Timing Analysis and Extraction Settings in the Fusion Compiler Timing Analysis User Guide The route_opt command supports both graph-based analysis (GBA), the default, and path-based analysis (PBA). To enable path-based optimization, use the time.pba_optimization_mode application option. To use path-based timing for the worst path of each endpoint, which is identified by using graph-based analysis, set this application option to path This is the recommended setting because it provides the best tradeoff between runtime and QoR. To use exhaustive path-based search algorithms for each endpoint, set this application option to exhaustive Using this setting increases the runtime. 2. Performs the enabled optimizations By default, the route_opt command optimizes for setup, hold, area, and logical DRC violations for the data paths in the block. To enable additional optimizations, set the application options shown in Table 33 before running the route_opt command: Table 33 Application Options to Enable route_opt Optimizations Optimization Application option settings route_opt.flow.enable_ccd true route_opt.flow.enable_cto true route_opt.flow.enable_clock_power_recovery area route_opt.flow.enable_clock_power_recovery power route_opt.flow.enable_power true route_opt.flow.enable_ml_opto true time.pba_optimization_mode path set_app_options -name route_opt.flow.enable_irdrivenopt -value true set_app_options -name opt.common.ir_drop_threshold -value 10 set_app_options-name opt.common.power_integrity-value true set_app_options -name ccd.ccd_opt_voltage_drop_enable_ml_predictor -value true Note: The route_opt command honors only the route_opt application options; it does not honor the settings of the opt application options, except the opt.common.allow_physical_feedthrough application option. 3. Legalizes the block 4. Performs ECO routing 6. For information about setting application options to control concurrent clock and data optimization, see Controlling Concurrent Clock and Data Optimization 7. This optimization is supported only when concurrent clock and data optimization is not enabled. 8. The type of power optimization performed depends on scenario configuration. Total power optimization is performed if there is an active scenario with both leakage power and dynamic power enabled. Leakage power optimization is performed if there is an active scenario with only leakage power enabled. By default, the route_opt command performs five detail routing iterations during the ECO routing phase. To change the number of iterations, use the route.detail.eco_max_number_of_iterations application option. To perform track assignment instead, set the route_opt.eco_route.mode application option to track If the PrimeTime tool reports setup or hold violations during signoff timing analysis, you can use the following process to fix these violations: 1. Specify the target endpoints and their PrimeTime timing information by using the set_route_opt_target_endpoints command with the -setup_timing and -hold_timing options. 2. Optimize the endpoints by using the route_opt command. 3. Remove the adjusted timing information by using the set_route_opt_target_endpoints -reset command. You can also use this process to perform incremental optimization on specific endpoints. In this case, use the -setup_endpoints -hold_endpoints, and -ldrc_objects options to specify the endpoints. To close the final setup, hold, or logical DRC violations with minimal disturbance to the block, use size-only mode when you run the route_opt command. To enable size- only mode, set the route_opt.flow.size_only_mode application option to one of the following values: true_footprint, which allows resizing a cell only to a library cell that is an exact physical match, as determined by the tool after analysis This ensures that legalization or ECO routing is not required after resizing footprint, which allows resizing a cell only to a library cell that has the same footprint attribute in the library equal, which allows resizing a cell only to a library cell that is equal in size equal_or_smaller, which allows resizing a cell only to a library cell that is equal or smaller in size To disable size-only mode, set the route_opt.flow.size_only_mode application option to none or \"\", which is the default."}]}

In some cases, you might want to restrict the library cells used for clock tree synthesis and optimization. For example, you might want to exclude specific double-height cells from the target library for some design blocks during optimization. To restrict the library cells used for clock tree synthesis and optimization, 1. Specify the library subset by using the set_target_library_subset command. By default, the library subset restriction applies to The top block and all its subblocks To set it for a specific subblock, use the -objects option. Both clock and data paths. To set it for only the clock or data paths, use the -clock or -data option. You can further restrict the target library subset setting as follows: Specify a list of cells from the libraries that should not be used by using the -dont_use option. Specify that these libraries cannot be used for any other objects, other than the specified objects, by using the -only_here option. 2. Enable the use of the target library subset by setting the opt.common.enable_target_library_subset_opt application option to 1. When you set target library subsets, remember the following points: The subset restriction applies to hierarchical cells but not to leaf cells. The command enforces the subset restriction on the specified blocks and their subdesigns in the hierarchy, except those subdesigns where a different subset restriction is set. A subset specified at a lower level supersedes any subset specified at a higher level. Logic Hierarchy of Design For example, assume your design has a logic hierarchy as shown in and you want to implement the following library restrictions during optimization and clock tree synthesis: Use only the cells from the library named LVT_lib for the Sub1 block and its subblocks, SubA and SubB. Do not use the cells from this library anywhere else in the design. To do so, use the following settings: fc_shell> set_target_library_subset -objects {top/Sub1} \\ -only_here [get_lib_cells LVT_lib/*] [get_libs LVT_lib] fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name opt.common.enable_target_library_subset_opt -value 1 In addition to these settings, assume you specify the following setting: fc_shell> set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts \\ {HVT_lib/buf1 HVT_lib/buf2 LVT_lib/buf1 LVT_lib/buf2} Then, when adding buffers on the clock network during clock tree synthesis, the tool uses The buf1 and buf2 cells from the LVT_lib library for the block named Sub1 and its subblocks The buf1 and buf2 cells from the HVT_lib library for the rest of the design Reporting Target Library Subsets To find out which target library subsets have been defined for a top block or hierarchical cell, use the report_target_library_subset command. Reports that are generated by reporting commands, such as report_cells and report_timing, show the td attribute attached to the cells that are specified by the -dont_use or -only_here option.

During logic optimization, the specified registers are replicated and the loads of the original registers are evenly distributed among the new replicated registers when the -num_copies option is used. When you use the -max_fanout option, the tool computes the number of copies and attempts to distribute loads evenly without violating the maximum fanout constraints.

You can control the following aspects of the filler cell insertion: The selection of filler cells based on lowest leakage current By default, the command does not consider leakage current when inserting filler cells. To reduce the leakage current, use the -leakage_vt_order option to specify the threshold voltage layers in order of decreasing leakage current. The command uses this information to select the filler cells with the lowest leakage current that meet the legalization requirements. To check whether the filler cells inserted in the current block result in the lowest possible leakage power, use the -leakage_vt_check option with the create_stdcell_fillers command. When you use this option, the command only checks the existing filler cells; it does not insert filler cells. You must also use the -lib_cells and -leakage_vt_order options to specify the available filler cells. The check reports the filler cells that could be replaced with a specified filler cell with lower leakage current without causing legalization errors. By default, the command reports a maximum of 100 violations. To change the maximum number of reported violations, set the chf.create_stdcell_fillers.max_leakage_vt_order_violations application option. Note: This feature has the following requirements: You must enable the advanced legalizer by setting the place.legalize.enable_advanced_legalizer application option to true. For more information about the advanced legalizer, see Enabling Advanced Legalization Algorithms The threshold voltage layers must be defined in the technology file. A threshold voltage layer is identified by a maskType attribute of implant in the Layer section of the technology file. The percentage of empty space to fill By default, the command fills all the empty space. To leave some empty space, use the -utilization option to specify the percentage of empty space to fill. To control the relative amount of various types of filler cells, such as ULVT and LVT decoupling capacitor cells, use the -type_utilization option to specify the insertion percentage for each type of cell. The sum of all the percentages specified in this option must be less than or equal to 100. When you use this option, the create_stdcell_fillers command might leave some empty spaces. To fill these empty spaces, use the -fill_remaining option. When you use this option, the command uses the cells specified in the -lib_cells option but not the -type_utilization option to fill the empty spaces. For example, # insert 70 percent ULVT cells, 30 percent LVT cells fc_shell> create_stdcell_fillers -lib_cells $FILLER_CELLS \\ -type_utilization { {*/DCAP16*ULVT */DCAP8*ULVT */DCAP4*ULVT */DCAP2*ULVT */DCAP1*ULVT} 70 {*/DCAP16*LVT */DCAP8*LVT */DCAP4*LVT */DCAP2*LVT */DCAP1*LVT} 30 } \\ -fill_remaining By default, the tool randomly selects the filler cells from the specified library cells. To control the cell selection priority, use the -prefer_type_ordering option with the -type_utilization option. When you use the -prefer_type_ordering option, the tool selects the library cells in each group specified in the -type_utilization option in priority order, from left to right. If some of the cells are difficult to insert due to legalization rules or library cell size, specify them before cells that are easier to insert to ensure that they are selected. For example, when the -prefer_type_ordering option is used with the previous example, the tool First tries to insert the ULVT decoupling capacitors to a utilization of 70 percent, first trying to insert */DCAP16*ULVT cells, then */DCAP8*ULVT cells, and so on Then tries to insert the LVT decoupling capacitors to a utilization of 30 percent, first trying to insert */DCAP16*LVT cells, then */DCAP8*LVT cells, and so on Then filling the remaining gaps using the remaining cells specified in the -lib_cells option # insert 70 percent ULVT cells, 30 percent LVT cells fc_shell> create_stdcell_fillers -lib_cells $FILLER_CELLS \\ -type_utilization { {*/DCAP16*ULVT */DCAP8*ULVT */DCAP4*ULVT */DCAP2*ULVT */DCAP1*ULVT} 70 {*/DCAP16*LVT */DCAP8*LVT */DCAP4*LVT */DCAP2*LVT */DCAP1*LVT} 30 } \\ -prefer_type_ordering -fill_remaining The region in which to insert the filler cells Use the -bboxes option to restrict filler cell insertion to the specified bounding boxes. Use the -voltage_area option to restrict filler cell insertion to the specified voltage areas. Whether to check for power net violations By default, the command does not check for power net violations, as this check increases runtime and is required only for metal filler cell insertion. However, this might result in the remove_stdcell_fillers_with_violation command removing many decoupling capacitors. To prevent power net violations caused by filler cell insertion, use the -rules check_pnet option. Gap prevention By default, the command assumes that the smallest cell size is one unit site. If the smallest cell in your design is larger than one unit site, this could cause gaps during filler cell insertion. To prevent the command from inserting filler cells that leave a gap, specify the smallest cell size as a multiple of the unit site by using the -smallest_cell_size option. You can specify a value of 1, 2, or 3. Note: The advanced legalizer automatically prevents gaps; therefore, this option is ignored when place.legalize.enable_advanced_legalizer application option is set to true The handling of hard placement blockages By default, the command honors hard placement blockages and does not insert filler cells in regions affected by these blockages. To ignore the hard placement blockages and insert filler cells in those regions, use the -ignore_hard_blockages option. The naming convention used to identify the inserted filler cell instances By default, the command uses the following naming convention for inserted filler cells: xofiller! filler_library_cell_name number To identify the filler cells inserted in a specific run, use the -prefix option to specify a prefix string. When you use this option, the command uses the following naming convention: xofiller! prefix filler_library_cell_name number The behavior when the legalizer detects errors By default, the command fails if the legalizer detects an error. To force the command to complete filler cell insertion even when errors occur, use the -continue_on_error option. When you use this option, the resulting block might have legalization errors that must be fixed manually."}]}

It removes hierarchical boundaries and allows Fusion Compiler to improve timing by reducing the levels of logic and to improve area by sharing logic. By default, the compile_fusion command automatically ungroups logical hierarchies that do not have a dont_touch attribute setting. During optimization, the compile_fusion command performs the following types of automatic grouping: Area-based automatic ungrouping Before initial mapping, the command estimates the area for unmapped hierarchies and removes small subdesigns. Because the command performs automatic ungrouping at an early stage, it has a better optimization context. Additionally, datapath extraction is enabled across ungrouped hierarchies. These factors improve the area and timing quality of results. Delay-based automatic ungrouping The command ungroups hierarchies along the critical path and is used essentially for timing optimization. For ungrouping of DesignWare and datapath cells, see Datapath Implementation You can disable automatic ungrouping by setting the compile.flow.autoungroup application option to false. The default is true. However, doing do can affect the QoR. Therefore, it is better to limit ungrouping, rather than disabling it, using the following methods: Controlling the Automatic Ungrouping of Specific Types of Hierarchies To control the automatic ungrouping of specific types of hierarchies, use the set_autoungroup_options command. The following example specifies that parent hierarchies of blocks with UPF and SDC constraints should preserved and that automatic ungrouping of other hierarchies should begin from the third level: fc_shell> set_autoungroup_options -keep_parent_hierarchies UPF fc_shell> set_autoungroup_options -keep_parent_hierarchies SDC fc_shell> set_autoungroup_options -start_level 3 The set_autoungroup_options command is cumulative and the settings are saved in the design library. To report information about the hierarchies that are automatically ungrouped or preserved, use the report_ungroup command. Controlling the Automatic Ungrouping of Specific Objects To force or prevent specific cell instances or modules being ungrouped during optimization, use the set_ungroup command with the true or false setting. The set_ungroup command sets the ungroup attribute to the appropriate value for the specified objects. If you set the attribute on a module, all cells that reference the module are affected. Note: The set_ungroup command has a higher priority than the set_autoungroup_options command. The following example script sets specific modules to be ungrouped and specific cell instances to be preserved during optimization: # Set modules A and B to be ungrouped set_ungroup [get_modules {A B}] true # Set cells u_C and u_D to be preserved set_ungroup [get_cells {u_C u_D}] false # Query the ungroup attribute get_attribute -name ungroup -objects [get_modules {A B}] get_attribute -name ungroup -objects [get_cells {u_C u_D}] compile_fusion"}]}

A child cell must inherit the same dont_touch attribute from its parent module. For example, you cannot remove the dont_touch attribute from a child cell when its parent module is marked with the dont_touch attribute. Use the command on fully mapped logic only, including cells, modules, and designs, as well as nets with fully mapped surrounding logic. The dont_touch attribute has higher precedence over the boundary_optimization and the size_only attributes. To report design objects marked with the dont_touch attribute, use the report_dont_touch command. This command sets the dont_touch attribute on cell A. fc_shell> set_dont_touch [get_cells A] true To remove the dont_touch attribute, use the remove_attributes command or the set_dont_touch command set to false, as shown in the following two commands: fc_shell> remove_attributes [get_cells A] dont_touch fc_shell> set_dont_touch [get_cells A] false The following table summaries the commands that you can use to set, remove, or report the dont_touch attribute on design objects, including modules, cells, nets, and library cells. Yes denotes the command operation of the dont_touch attribute is supported, while No denotes the command operation is not supported.

Timing-driven metal fill insertion is supported for both pattern-based and track-based metal fill insertion. By default, the tool does not perform timing-driven metal fill insertion. To perform timing-driven metal fill insertion, use one or both of the following options with the signoff_create_metal_fill command: -nets This option explicitly specifies the critical nets. -timing_preserve_setup_slack_threshold This option enables the tool to automatically determine the critical nets based on a setup slack threshold.

For metal fill on the same layer as the net shape, the default minimum spacing is two times the minimum spacing value specified for the layer in the technology file. For metal fill on layers adjacent to the net shape, the default minimum spacing is the minimum spacing value specified for the layer in the technology file. For example, assume that the red rectangle in is a critical net shape. The yellow regions indicate where fill cannot be inserted and the gray regions indicate the inserted fill. Minimum Spacing From Metal Fill to Critical Net Shape To override the default spacing requirements for timing-driven metal fill insertion, set the following application options: signoff.create_metal_fill.space_to_nets This application option defines the same-layer minimum spacing requirements between metal fill and a net shape of a timing-critical net. signoff.create_metal_fill.space_to_clock_nets This application option defines the same-layer minimum spacing requirements between metal fill and a net shape of a user-defined clock net that is specified in the -nets option. signoff.create_metal_fill.space_to_nets_on_adjacent_layer This application option defines the adjacent-layer minimum spacing requirements between metal fill and a net shape of a timing-critical net. signoff.create_metal_fill.space_to_clock_nets_on_adjacent_layer This application option defines the adjacent-layer minimum spacing requirements between metal fill and a net shape of a user-defined clock net that is specified in the -nets option. For each of these application options, use the following syntax to specify the spacing to use for each layer: { { layer value }... { layer value } } You can specify the spacing value either as a multiple of the minimum spacing ( x) or a distance in microns. For example, to set the minimum spacing between metal fill and a timing-critical net on the same layer to four times the minimum spacing for the M2 and M3 layers, use the following command: fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name signoff.create_metal_fill.space_to_nets \\ -value {{M2 4x} {M3 4x}} To set the minimum spacing between metal fill and a timing-critical net on the same layer to 0.125 microns for the M2 layer and 0.133 microns for the M3 layer, use the following command: fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name signoff.create_metal_fill.space_to_nets \\ -value {{M2 0.125} {M3 0.133}} Defining the Density Design Rules The IC Validator tool can check and fix the following density design rules: Minimum density, which specifies the minimum percentage of metal allowed in the density checking window This rule is checked when you enable density error fixing by setting the signoff.create_metal_fill.fix_density_errors application option to true By default, the IC Validator tool uses the setting defined for the minDensity attribute in the DensityRule sections of the technology file. If this attribute is not defined for a layer, the IC Validator tool uses a default of 10 percent. To override the default, define the _min_density parameter in the IC Validator parameter file. Density gradient, which specifies the maximum percentage difference between the fill density of adjacent density checking windows This rule is checked if it is defined in the technology file and you enable density error fixing by setting the signoff.create_metal_fill.fix_density_errors application option to true The IC Validator tool uses the setting defined for the maxGradientDensity attribute in the DensityRule sections of the technology file.

Tap drivers for regular multisource clock trees. When you insert mesh or tap drivers, Specify the loads to drive by using the -loads option. The load can be a net or a set of pins or ports connected to the same net. Specify where to add the clock drivers as exact locations by using the -location option. Alternatively, you can add the clock drivers in an X by Y grid pattern over the entire core area by using the -boxes option. You can limit the X by Y grid pattern to a specific area by using the -boundary option with the -boxes option. Specify a list of cells that can be used as clock drivers by using the -lib_cells option. You can specify both single-rail and dual-rail library cells. Alternatively, you can select the existing driver of the load net as a template for the clock drivers by using the -template option. If the template cell you specify is a buffer or inverter, you can also specify different versions of this buffer or inverter as clock drivers by using the -lib_cells option with the -template option. When you insert mesh drivers, to specify that the outputs of all the clock drivers must be connected together to drive the mesh net, use the -short_outputs option. The following example creates a grid of eight by eight mesh drivers, places them in a regular pattern that covers the full core area, shorts the outputs of the clock drivers and connects to the net named clk_mesh, and transfers preexisting routing shapes and vias from the net named clk to this net: fc_shell> create_clock_drivers -loads [get_nets clk1_mesh] \\ -boxes {8 8} -lib_cells [get_lib_cells my_lib/CKBUF8X] \\ -short_outputs -output_net_name clk_mesh \\ -transfer_wires_from [get_nets clk] The following example creates a grid of five by five tap drivers that are placed within the rectangle bounded at the lower-left by (200, 200) and upper right by (1000, 1000). fc_shell> create_clock_drivers -loads [get_nets clkA] -lib_cells [get_lib_cells my_lib/CKBUF8X] \\ -boxes {5 5} -boundary [list {{200 200} {1000 1000}} ] In this example, one of the tap drivers drives all the loads of the original clock net named clkA. To distribute the loads among all the clock drivers, you must subsequently perform automated multisource tap assignment by using the synthesize_multisource_clock_taps command, as described in Specifying Tap Assignment Options and Settings You can use the create_clock_drivers to add multiple levels of clock drivers by using the -configuration option and specifying the configuration of drivers at each level. The following example inserts three levels of clock drivers. The first level consists of one buffer, the second level consists of four inverters in a 2x2 grid, and the third level consists of 16 inverters in a 4x4 grid. fc_shell> create_clock_drivers -loads [get_nets clk] \\ -configuration [list \\ [list -level 1 -boxes {1 1} -lib_cells buf32x ] \\ [list -level 2 -boxes {2 2} -lib_cells inv16x ] \\ [list -level 3 -boxes {4 4} -lib_cells inv8x ]] For this example, because there is no bounding box specified at any level, the drivers at each level are evenly distributed in the core area. The buffer in the first level is placed at the center of the core area, the four buffers in the next level are placed at the center of the four quadrants of the core area, and so on, resulting in an evenly placed clock drivers that can be routed to form an H-tree structure as shown in Clock Drivers Placed in an H-Tree Structure After it inserts the clock drivers, the tool marks the clock drivers that it inserts as fixed and don't touched. The tool avoids overlapping the clock drivers with other fixed cells, blockages, and macros. However, the clock drivers can overlap with cells that are not fixed. The create_clock_drivers command does not legalize the design. To do so, run the legalize_placement command. If you run the create_clock_drivers command multiple times, to reduce runtime, run the legalize_placement command one time, after you complete all the create_clock_drivers command runs. When routing the H-trees, the tool uses the highest routing layers available, based on the routing rules specified for the clock nets. These same layers can contain prerouted nets such as power and ground nets. To prevent placing clock drivers under these preroutes, which can cause pin accessibility issues, the create_clock_drivers command creates temporary placement blockages for the preroutes on the same layers it uses for routing. After it completes routing, it removes these temporary placement blockages, as shown in the following example output.... Net: clk; Rule: htree_ndr; Min Layer: M8; Max Layer: M9...

If you specify multirow-height cells with the -lib_cell option of the create_clock_drivers command, the tool might not be able to place them due to the temporary placement blockages it creates for the preroutes. If so, you can prevent the tool from creating the temporary placement blockages by setting the cts.multisource.enable_pin_accessibility_for_global_clock_trees application option to false To remove clock drivers inserted by the create_clock_drivers command, use the remove_clock_drivers command."}]}

To enable the tool to infer synchronous reset or preset flip-flops or preserve the synchronous reset or preset logic close to the flip-flop, use either of the following two methods: The sync_set_reset directive Specify the //synopsys sync_set_reset directive in the RTL. The hdlin.elaborate.ff_infer_sync_set_reset application option When the RTL does not contain the directive, set the hdlin.elaborate.ff_infer_sync_set_reset application option to true.

The library containing no registers with synchronous reset (or preset) pins The tool adds extra logic to the data input to generate the reset (or preset) condition on a register without a reset (or preset) pin.

Set up the IC Validator environment as described in Setting Up the IC Validator Environment 4. (Optional) Enable distributed processing by using the set_host_options command, as described in Enabling IC Validator Multicore Processing 5. Set the application options for performing power grid augmentation, as described in Setting Options for Power Grid Augmentation At a minimum, you must define the power and ground nets on which to perform PG augmentation. To specify the power net, set the signoff.create_pg_augmentation.power_net_name application option. To specify the ground net, set the signoff.create_pg_augmentation.ground_net_name application option. If your design contains more than one power net, you must perform PG augmentation once for each power net. 6. Save the block to disk. When you run the signoff_create_pg_augmentation command, the IC Validator tool uses the on-disk information for the block, not the information in memory. To ensure accurate information, use the save_block command to save the current state of the block before running the signoff_create_pg_augmentation command. 7. Perform power grid augmentation by using the signoff_create_pg_augmentation command. When you run this command, you must specify the technology node for which to perform the augmentation by using the -node option.

Run voltage drop analysis using RedHawk Fusion, as described in Performing Voltage Drop Analysis This second voltage drop analysis run measures the voltage drop after power grid augmentation. During standard PG augmentation, the signoff_create_pg_augmentation command performs the following tasks: 1. Inserts PG augmentation shapes for the specified regions When the IC Validator tool inserts the PG augmentation shapes, it considers the routing design rules to ensure that it does not create design rule violations. By default, the command performs PG augmentation for the entire block. To specify the regions for PG augmentation, use one or more of the following options: -coordinates_ground This option restricts PG augmentation for the ground net to the specified regions. -excluded_coordinates_ground This option prevents PG augmentation for the ground net in the specified regions. If you specify this option with the -coordinates_ground option, the command does not perform PG augmentation in the overlapping regions. -coordinates_power This option restricts PG augmentation for the power net to the specified regions. -excluded_coordinates_power This option prevents PG augmentation for the power net in the specified regions. If you specify this option with the -coordinates_power option, the command does not perform PG augmentation in the overlapping regions. The shapes added during PG augmentation have a shape_use attribute of pg_augmentation. You can use this attribute to query the shapes added during PG augmentation. For example, fc_shell> get_shapes -filter {shape_use=~pg_augmentation} 2. Generates a summary report that shows the following information for each PG net: The distribution of power grid augmentation shapes added on each layer The total number of metal shapes added, the total number of via shapes added, and the total number of all shapes added 3.

Define the global routing application options For information about the global routing application options, see the route.global_options man page. To perform standalone global routing, use the route_global command. By default, global routing is not timing-driven. For information about enabling timing-driven global routing, see Timing-Driven Global Routing The global router divides a block into global routing cells. By default, the width of a global routing cell is the same as the height of a standard cell and is aligned with the standard cell rows. For each global routing cell, the routing capacity is calculated according to the blockages, pins, and routing tracks inside the cell. Although the nets are not assigned to the actual wire tracks during global routing, the number of nets assigned to each global routing cell is noted. The tool calculates the demand for wire tracks in each global routing cell and reports the overflows, which are the number of wire tracks that are still needed after the tool assigns nets to the available wire tracks in a global routing cell. For advanced node designs, via density can be a concern. To enable via density modeling, set the route.global.via_cut_modeling application option to true. The tool then calculates the number of vias in each global routing cell and reports via overflows. Global routing is done in two phases: The initial routing phase (phase 0), in which the tool routes the unconnected nets and calculates the overflow for each global routing cell The rerouting phases, in which the tool tries to reduce congestion by ripping up and rerouting nets around global routing cells with overflows The tool might perform several rerouting phases. At the end of each rerouting phase, the tool recalculates the overflows. You should see a reduction in the total number of global routing cells with overflow and in the total overflow numbers. The global router stops and exits from the rerouting phase when the congestion is solved or cannot be solved further or after the maximum number of phases has occurred, as defined by the -effort_level option. You can force the global router to perform the maximum number of phases based on the specified effort level by setting the route.global.force_full_effort application option to true. By default, the tool uses medium effort and performs a maximum of three rerouting phases. You can perform up to six rerouting phases by specifying ultra effort. There are five global routing effort levels: minimum low medium high, and ultra Minimum ( -effort_level minimum The minimum effort level uses two times larger global routing cells relative to the other effort levels. It also has a much lower congestion cost and runs only one rerouting phase. It should only be used for prototype routing or for an initial congestion evaluation, not for detail routing. Low ( -effort_level low Low effort runs a maximum of two rerouting phases with very similar congestion cost. It is faster in comparison to medium effort and has reasonable QoR. If your block is not very congested, you can use the low effort level. Medium ( -effort_level medium Medium effort is the default effort level and runs a maximum of three rerouting phases. Global routing stops after the third phase or when the overflow is resolved, whichever occurs first. High ( -effort_level high High effort runs up to four rerouting phases. If your block is congested, use the high effort level. Ultra ( -effort_level ultra Ultra effort runs up to six rerouting phases. If your block is very congested, use the ultra effort level. At the end of global routing, the following information is stored in the design library: The g-links and g-vias on each routed net This information is used for the next routing steps. After Zroute performs track assignment and detail routing, it removes these g-links and g-vias from the design library. The congestion data This information is used to generate a congestion map. By default, only the hard congestion data is saved in the design library. To also save the soft congestion data, set the route.global.export_soft_congestion_maps application option to true before performing global routing. The soft congestion data includes demand from soft nondefault spacing rules, as well as tool-generated soft rules. The global router reports block statistics and congestion data after the initial routing phase and after each rerouting phase. When global routing is complete, the global router reports a summary of the wire length and via count. Example 19 shows a global routing report. In the congestion report, the Overflow value is the total number of wires in the block that do not have a corresponding track available. The Max value corresponds to the highest number of overutilized wires in a single global routing cell. The GRCs value is the total number of overcongested global routing cells in the block.

You should help the user to answer their question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I Working With Macro Models"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Fusion Compiler tool can resize power switch cells to reduce total power and to mitigate the voltage drop in the design. Power switch cells have different voltage thresholds (V ) and are classified as high, standard, low, and ultra-low. For a power cell with high threshold voltage, the power consumption and leakage current is low, but the timing is also slow with a smaller drive strength. For a power cell with a low threshold voltage, the timing is faster but the power consumption and leakage current is high. With power switch cell sizing, the tool supports different drive strength and voltage threshold to reduce IR (voltage) drop in the design. Note: When the tool switches power cells (swapping), it can only swap cells with the same footprint but with different threshold voltages. This means, the cell cannot be swapped if the cell size and pin shapes are different. To perform power switch cell swapping, you can use the size_power_switches command to set the maximum IR drop target. To meet this target when swapping power cells, the tool tries to find another cell with higher V, but lower R ON value, so that it can reduce the IR drop. You can set the ON resistance (R ON ) value to be considered by the tool for swapping using the set_power_switch_resistance command. Based on the IR drop target and the set R ON value of the power cell, the tool tries to replace power cells to meet the targeted voltage drop. Note: If the tool does not find any suitable power cell that matches the targeted voltage drop and R ON value, it skips cell resizing. To perform voltage driven cell sizing, 1. Perform a voltage drop analysis using RH Fusion to get the maximum voltage drop of the cells driven by the power switch in question. Refer Performing Voltage Drop Analysis for more information. 2. Set the RON value limit to be considered for cell switching using the set_power_switch_resistance command. Provide the following values as input, Lib cell name - specifies the name of the library cell. On resistance value - specifies the RON value limit to be considered for cell sizing. You can get this information from the switch model files. For example, fc_shell> set_power_switch_resistance saed32hvt_pg_ss0p_v125c/HEAD2X2_HVT 0.015 3. Run the size_power_switches command to perform cell size switching. Provide the value for -max_irdrop option which specifies the allowed maximum effective voltage drop on supply nets for standard cells driven by switches. This is a mandatory input. For example, fc_shell> size_power_switches -max_irdop 0.05 For the other non-mandatory inputs to further refine the command action, see the man page for the size_power_switches command. The tool also provides the following commands to further help with power switch resistance: get_power_switch_resistance - This command fetches the R ON value of a power switch cell. reset_power_switch_resistance - This command resets the R ON value specified for a power switch cell. report_power_switch_resistance - This command reports all power switch library cells with a set R ON. Use the -verbose option with the command to display the group of cells with the same footprint, the R on value and the number of cells instantiated in the design. When using the -verbose option, you can also use -same_vt option to report power switch cells and their R ON value from current library with same VT but different driving strength cells."}]}

The existing cells are untouched to minimize the impact to their placement. You can control the legalization of the ECO cells by using one of the following methods: To not legalize the cells after ECO placement, use the -no_legalize option. To perform legalization only, use the -legalize_only option. To specify the mode in which to legalize, use the -legalize_mode option with one of the following settings: free_site_only When you specify this setting, the default, the tool legalizes the ECO cells on free sites without moving preexisting cells. An ECO cells can have a large displacement, if a free site is unavailable nearby. allow_move_other_cells When you specify this setting, the tool legalizes the ECO cells to the nearest legal location by moving preexisting cells. minimum_physical_impact When you specify this setting, the tool first legalizes the ECO cells the can be legalized to a free site nearby without moving preexisting cells. For the ECO cells that do not have a free site nearby, the tool legalizes them by moving preexisting cells. To specify a displacement threshold for legalization, use the -displacement_threshold option. When you use the -displacement_threshold option, you can also use the -max_displacement_threshold option to specify a second displacement threshold that is larger than the value specified with the -displacement_threshold option. How the tool uses these displacement thresholds depends on the setting you use for the -legalize_mode option as follows: free_site_only When you specify this setting, the tool legalizes the ECO cells that have available free sites within the specified displacement threshold. If the displacement of an ECO cell exceeds this threshold, the tool does not legalize the cell. It creates a collection named epl_legalizer_rejected_cells that consists of such ECO cells that are not legalized. You can subsequently legalize the ECO cells in the epl_legalizer_rejected_cells collection by using the following command: fc_shell> place_eco_cells -legalize_mode allow_move_other_cells \\ -legalize_only -cells $epl_legalizer_rejected_cells This command moves existing cells to find legal locations for the ECO cells in the collection named epl_legalizer_rejected_cells. If you also specify the -max_displacement_threshold option with -displacement_threshold option, the tool also creates a collection named epl_max_displacement_cells that consists of ECO cells with a displacement larger than that specified by this option. The collection epl_max_displacement_cells is a subset of the collection epl_legalizer_rejected_cells and its cells are also not legalized. You can use the -max_displacement_threshold option to identify ECO cells with a very large displacement, for which you want to reject the ECO changes. allow_move_other_cells When you specify this setting, you cannot specify the -displacement_threshold and -max_displacement_threshold options. minimum_physical_impact When you specify this setting, the tool first legalizes the ECO cells that have available free sites within the specified displacement threshold. If the displacement of an ECO cell exceeds this threshold, the tool legalizes them by moving preexisting cells. If you also specify the -max_displacement_threshold option, the tool does not legalize the cells that exceed this maximum displacement threshold specified with this option and the tool creates a collection named epl_max_displacement_cells that consists of ECO cells with a displacement larger than that specified by this option. You can use the -max_displacement_threshold option to identify ECO cells with a very large displacement, for which you want to reject the ECO changes. To specify the types of filler cells that can be removed during legalization, use the -remove_filler_references option. When you use this option, the filler cells are removed if they do not have a fixed placement and they overlap with ECO cells. By default, the tool does not remove any filler cells when legalizing ECO cells. To enable Advanced Legalizer and remove the filler cells that have violations, set the place.legalize.enable_advanced_legalizer application option to true When you specify this setting, the filler cells that have violations are removed after legalizing ECO cells. Using the -remove_filler_references option with this application option set to true results in the legalizer engine removing only those fillers that are specified by this option.

Physical-Feedthrough Nets of Voltage Areas VA0 (PD0 ) VA1 (PD1) N1 Top (PD0) Block1 (PD1) N1 Physical view Logical view By default, physical-feedthrough nets are allowed in voltage areas. To prevent physical-feedthrough nets in a voltage area, define a voltage area rule using the create_voltage_area_rule -allow_pass_through false command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_voltage_area_rule -allow_pass_through false \\ -name VA1_rule -voltage_areas VA1 With this rule, the N1 net detours around the VA1 voltage area, as shown in Physical-Feedthrough Nets Disabled for a Voltage Area VA0 N1 VA1 By default, optimization does not insert buffers on physical-feedthrough nets of voltage areas. Inserting a buffer on a physical-feedthrough net can cause a mismatch between the logical and physical view of the buffer. The tool resolves such mismatches by supporting the following types of optimization for such nets: Physical-feedthrough buffering During physical-feedthrough buffering the tool performs the following: 1. Inserts buffers in the logical hierarchy of its drivers or loads and applies the power domain of the nonnative voltage area on the buffer using power-domain-on-instance (PDOI) constraints 2. Places the buffers within the nonnative voltage area To allow physical-feedthrough buffering, use the create_voltage_area_rule -allow_physical_feedthrough true command, as shown in the following example: fc_shell> create_voltage_area_rule \\ -allow_physical_feedthrough true \\ -name VA1_rule -voltage_areas VA1 Logical-feedthrough buffering During logical-feedthrough the tool performs the following: 1. Adds buffers in the logical hierarchy corresponding to the nonnative voltage area 2. Places the buffers within the nonnative voltage area To allow logical-feedthrough buffering, use the create_voltage_area_rule -allow_logical_feedthrough true command. To specify logical hierarchies in which feedthrough buffers are allowed or not allowed, use the -include_logical_feedthrough_hierarchy or -exclude_logical_feedthrough_hierarchy option, respectively.

Table 7 Design Rule Commands To do this Use this command set_min_capacitance set_max_capacitance set_max_transition remove_min_capacitance Table 7 Design Rule Commands (Continued) To do this Use this command remove_max_capacitance remove_max_transition report_constraints -min_capacitance report_constraints -max_capacitance report_constraints -max_transition set_connection_class set_attribute \\ -name connection_class Note: The maximum fanout design rule constraint is not honored by the Fusion Compiler tool. However, you can specify a maximum fanout for the data paths in a block by using the opt.common.max_fanout application option. This is a soft optimization constraint. During optimization the tool tries to ensure that data path cells do not drive more than the specified maximum fanout."}]}

Example for Diode Modes 5 and 6 Assume that the antenna area is calculated using surface area in single-layer mode (antenna mode 1), the diode ratio vector for the M1 layer is {0 0 1 0} (the default diode ratio vector), the layerMaxRatio value for the M1 layer is 400, and the following diodes are connected to a single M1 net: diode A with a diode-protection value of 0.5, diode B with a diode-protection value of 1.0, and diode C with a diode-protection value of 1.5. In this example, the v4 value is not specified so a value of 0 is used. Use the following command to define the antenna rules for this example: fc_shell> define_antenna_rule -mode 1 -diode_mode diode_mode -metal_ratio 400 -cut_ratio 20 Because this example uses the global layerMaxRatio value and the default diode ratio vector, you do not need to define a layer-specific antenna rule. As shown in Table 37, for diode modes 5 and 6, the maximum antenna ratio is computed as metal_area / ( gate_area equi_gate_area where the equivalent gate area, equi_gate_area, is computed by using the diode ratio vector: ( diode_protection v1 ) * ( v2 v3 ). For diode mode 5, the equivalent gate area is computed using the maximum diode protection, which is 1.5, so the maximum antenna ratio for the net is metal_area / ( gate_area + ((1.5 + 0) * (1 + 0))) = metal_area /(gate_area + 1.5) For diode mode 6, the equivalent gate area is computed using the total diode protection, which is 0.5+1.0+1.5=3.0, so the maximum antenna ratio for the net is metal_area / (gate_area + ((3.0 + 0) * (1 + 0))) = metal_area /(gate_area + 3.0) Example for Diode Modes 7 and 8 Assume that the antenna area is calculated using surface area in single-layer mode (antenna mode 1), the diode ratio vector for the M1 layer is {0.7 0.0 150 800}, the layerMaxRatio value for the M1 layer is 400, and the following diodes are connected to a single M1 net: diode A with a diode-protection value of 0.5, diode B with a diode-protection value of 1.0, and diode C with a diode-protection value of 1.5.

For diode mode 7, the equivalent metal area is computed using the maximum diode protection, which is 1.5, so the maximum antenna ratio for the net is metal_area - ((1.5 + 0) * (150 + 800))) / gate_area = ( metal_area - 1025) / gate_area For diode mode 8, the equivalent metal area is computed using the total diode protection, which is 0.5+1.0+1.5=3.0, so the maximum antenna ratio for the net is metal_area - ((3.0 + 0) * 150 + 800)) / gate_area = ( metal_area - 1250) / gate_area Example for Diode Mode 14 With Multiple Gate Oxide Thicknesses Assume that the antenna area is calculated using surface area in single-layer mode (antenna mode 1), the design contains cells with two different gate oxide thicknesses, the diode ratio vector for the first oxide thickness (gate class 0) for the M1 layer is {1 0 1e9 1e9 0 1 2 285 1 285}, the diode ratio vector for the second oxide thickness (gate class 1) for the M1 layer is {1 0 1e9 1e9 1 0 2 165 1 28}, and the layerMaxRatio value for the M1 layer is 285. For diode mode 14, the diode ratio vector contains 10 values for each gate class. Because the design uses only two gate oxide thicknesses, only the vectors for gate class 0 and gate class 1 are used. However, you must specify all 40 values when defining the antenna rule. For unused gate classes (gate class 2 and gate class 3 in this example), specify very large ratios to disable the checks. Use the following commands to define the antenna rules for this example: fc_shell> define_antenna_rule -mode 1 -diode_mode 14 \\ -metal_ratio 285 -cut_ratio 10 fc_shell> define_antenna_layer_rule -mode 1 -layer \"M1\" \\ -ratio 285 -diode_ratio {1 0 1e9 1e9 0 1 2 285 1 285 \\ 1 0 1e9 1e9 1 0 2 165 1 28 \\ 1 0 1e9 1e9 0 1 2 1e9 1 1e9 \\ 1 0 1e9 1e9 0 1 2 1e9 1 1e9 } The following table shows the vector usage: Here: V0: Defines which gate areas are used for the check for the first formula: 0: Gate area of all gates that belong to the current gate class 1: Total gate area regardless of gate class V1: Defines the diode protection multiplier for the connected to diode case for the first formula V2: Defines the offset value for the connected to diode case for the first formula V3: Defines the ratio requirement for the not connected to diode case for the first formula V4: Defines which gate areas are used for the check for the second formula: 0: Gate area of all gates that belong to the current gate class 1: Total gate area regardless of gate class V5: Defines the gate area multiplier for the connected to diode case for the second formula V6: Defines the diode protection multiplier for the connected to diode case for the second formula V7: Defines the ratio requirement for the connected to diode case for the second formula V8: Defines the gate area multiplier for the not connected to diode case for the second formula V9: Defines the antenna ratio requirement for the not connected to diode case for the second formula"}]}

This command can replace single-cut vias with multiple-cut via arrays, single-cut vias with other single-cut vias that have a different contact code, and multiple-cut via arrays with different multiple-cut via arrays. During redundant via insertion, the detail router also checks the design rules within the neighboring partition to minimize DRC violations. By default, the add_redundant_vias command inserts redundant vias on all nets. To insert redundant vias only on specific nets, use the -nets option to specify the nets. Using net-specific redundant via insertion allows you to further improve the optimized via rate without causing large-scale routing and timing changes. After the vias are checked and replaced, the detail router rechecks for DRC violations and corrects any violations. If the percentage of redundant vias is not high enough, you can increase the effort level by using the -effort option to get a better redundant via rate. Increasing the effort level to high can increase the redundant via rate by about 3 to 5 percent by shifting the vias to make room for additional vias. However, because high-effort redundant via insertion moves the vias more, it can result in a less lithography-friendly pattern at the 45-nm technology node and below. In this case, you should use concurrent soft-rule-based redundant via insertion to improve the redundant via rate. You can also try to increase the postroute redundant via rate by setting the route.detail.optimize_wire_via_effort_level application option to high, which reduces the number of single vias and makes more room for redundant vias by reducing wire length. After you perform the initial postroute redundant via insertion, set the route.common.post_detail_route_redundant_via_insertion application option to enable automatic insertion of redundant vias after subsequent detail routing or ECO routing. This helps to maintain the redundant via rate in your block."}]}

Note: You can insert interior tap walls only for designs with a single site definition. To insert an interior tap wall, use the create_interior_tap_walls command. You must specify the following information: The tap cell used in the tap wall (the -lib_cell option) The specified tap cell must be a single-height cell that matches the row height and site width. By default, the command inserts the tap cells with the row orientation. To place the cells with a different orientation, use the -orientation option. By default, the tool uses the following naming convention for inserted tap cells: tapfiller__ library_cell_name _R _C number To identify the tap cells inserted in a specific run, use the -prefix option to specify a prefix string. When you use this option, the tool uses the following naming convention: prefix __ library_cell_name _R _C number The side along which to insert the tap wall (the -side option) You can specify only a single side, top bottom right, or left. To insert a tap wall on more than one side, run the command multiple times. By default, the tap cells are placed along all edges on the specified side of the standard cell placement area with no gaps between the tap cells. To specify the tap insertion region, use the -bbox option to specify the lower-left and upper-right corners of its bounding box: -bbox {{ llx lly } { urx ury }} When you use this option, the command inserts a tap wall along the longest edge on the specified side of the placeable area encompassed by the bounding box. The alignment of the tap wall depends on the number of corners of the edge segment encompassed by the bounding box. If the edge segment does not contain a corner, the tap wall starts at the left edge for a horizontal tap wall or the bottom edge for a vertical tap wall. If the edge segment contains one corner, the tap wall starts at that corner. If the edge segment contains two corners along the specified side, the tap wall starts at the left edge for a horizontal tap wall or the bottom edge for a vertical tap wall. For a horizontal tap wall with two corners, the spacing between the last two cells might be shortened to align with the right corner. If there is not enough space, the last cell might not abut the right corner. For horizontal tap walls, you can specify a gap distance between tap cells by using the -x_spacing option. If you specify a value smaller than the tap cell width, the command uses a spacing of zero. If you specify a value that is not a multiple of the site width, the command rounds it down to a multiple of the site width. When inserting the tap wall, the command honors the standard cell rows and sites; if the rows and sites are not defined, the command does not insert tap cells. Obstructions such as placement blockages, fixed cells, and macros can prevent the insertion of the tap cells and result in an incomplete or missing tap wall. After insertion, the command fixes the placement of the inserted tap cells."}]}

At a minimum, you must specify the source via and its replacement vias by using the -from and -to options. The vias listed in these options must be either vias defined in the technology file or design-specific vias created by the create_via_def command. The vias listed in the -from option must be simple vias or via arrays. The vias listed in the -to option can be simple vias, simple via arrays, or custom vias. For information about creating design- specific vias, see Defining Vias Use the following options to refine the via mapping: -weight By default, all mappings have the same priority, and Zroute selects the redundant vias to use based on routability. To set the priority for a mapping, use the -weight option to assign an integer weight value between 1 and 10 to the mapping. If you do not assign a weight, the tool assigns a weight of 1. During redundant via insertion, Zroute uses the higher weighted redundant vias first. -transform By default, Zroute can rotate or flip the via arrays during redundant via insertion (the -transform all option). To allow only rotation of the via arrays during redundant via insertion, use the -transform rotate option. To allow only flipping of the via arrays during redundant via insertion, use the -transform flip option. To allow only the specified orientation of the via array during redundant via insertion, use the -transform none option. The tool saves the mappings defined by the add_via_mapping command in a via mapping table in the design library. By default, if you try to add a via mapping that already exists in the table, the command fails. To overwrite an existing mapping definition, use the -force option. Example 28 shows an example of using the add_via_mapping command to define a customized via mapping table. Example 28 Customized Via Mapping Table fc_shell> add_via_mapping \\ -from {VIA12 1x1} -to {VIA12T 2x1} -weight 5 fc_shell> add_via_mapping \\ -from {VIA12 1x1} -to {VIA12 2x1} -weight 1 To see the customized via mappings associated with a block, use the report_via_mapping command. By default, this command shows all user-defined via mappings. To show the via mappings for specific source vias, use the -from option. To show the via mappings for specific replacement vias, use the -to option. To remove mappings from the via mapping table, use the remove_via_mappings command. To remove all via mappings, use the -all option. To remove the via mappings for specific source vias, use the -from option. To remove the via mappings for specific replacement vias, use the -to option. Using a Subset of the Via Mapping Table for Redundant Via Insertion To use a subset of the via mapping table for redundant via insertion, specify which weight groups from the via mapping table to use by setting one or both of the route.common.redundant_via_include_weight_group_by_layer_name and route.common.redundant_via_exclude_weight_group_by_layer_name application options. If you set only the route.common.redundant_via_include_weight_group_by_layer_name application option, Zroute selects redundant vias only from the specified weight groups. If you do not specify an entry for a layer, redundant via insertion is not performed on that layer. If you set only the route.common.redundant_via_exclude_weight_group_by_layer_name application option, Zroute selects redundant vias from all weight groups in the original via mapping table, except the specified weight groups. If you do not specify an entry for a layer, all weight groups are used for that layer. If you set both application options, Zroute selects redundant vias from the weight groups specified in the route.common.redundant_via_include_weight_group_by_layer_name application, excluding the weight groups specified in the route.common.redundant_via_exclude_weight_group_by_layer_name application option."}]}

You can use this command to implement A clock mesh, which is a two-dimensional grid in a horizontal and a vertical layer, where the straps are connected by vias at the intersection points, as shown in A clock spine, which can be either a one- or two-dimensional structures. One-dimensional spines are straps in a single direction. Two-dimensional spines consists of one-dimensional spines connected to multiple stripes in the orthogonal direction. Stripes connected to one spine do not connect to stripes of a different spine and the minimum distance between the stripes of different spines is called the backoff, as shown in Clock Mesh Structure Boundary of clock mesh Start distance for Incremental step for subsequent straps (0,0) Start distance for Incremental step for subsequent straps first vertical strap first horizontal strap End distance for last vertical strap End distance for last horizontal strap Clock Spine Structure Boundary of clock spine (0,0) Backoff Stripes Spine The horizontal and vertical start, end, and step distances are applicable for clock spine structures too. When you use the create_clock_straps command, To specify the clock net for which to create the structure, use the -net option. To specify the bounding box to confine the structure, use the -boundary option. To specify keepouts, use the -keepouts option. If part of a strap is over a keepout, by default, the tool splits the strap and creates the portions that are outsides the keepouts. However, you can disable splitting and specify that the tool not create a strap if it is over a keepout by using the -allow_splitting false option. To specify the layers on which create the straps, use the -layers option. The tool determines the direction of the straps based on the metal layer you specify. To create straps in both directions, specify a layer for each direction. To specify the width of the straps, use the -width option. To specify where to create the straps, use the -grid option as follows: To create a single horizontal or vertical strap, specify the distance from the x- or y- axis. To create a multiple straps in a single direction, specify an iterator list consisting of the start distance to the first strap, the end distance to the last strap, and the incremental distance between straps. To create a multiple straps in a both the horizontal and vertical directions, specify an iterator list for each direction, starting with the horizontal direction. Use the -grid option to create multiple straps for both the clock mesh and clock spine structures. To specify a margin within which the tool can move a strap from the position it derives based on the -grid option settings, use the -margins option. If the tool cannot create a strap within the specified margin, due to obstructions or keepouts, it does not create the strap. By default, the tool uses a margin of zero and only creates the strap if it can do so at the exact position it derives. To create straps on the boundary specified with the -boundary option, use the -create_ends option. To allow straps that are unconnected to orthogonal straps, use the -allow_floating true option. By default, the tool does not allow orthogonal straps that are unconnected. To specify the type of straps to create, use the -type option and specify user_route stripe, or detect When you create straps in both direction, specify a list of two values starting with the type for the horizontal direction. You can specify detect as the type only when you are creating a clock spine structure and want the tool to detect and use existing spines. When you do so, you must specify a list consisting of the type for the orthogonal stripes and detect, with the type for the horizontal direction specified first in the list. In addition, when the tool detects existing spine, you can specify a minimum length for the spine, by using the -detect_length option. To specify the maximum length of the orthogonal stripes, when creating a clock spine structure, use the -length option. To specify the backoff distance between stripes of different spines, when creating a clock spine structure, use the -backoff option. To specify the direction of the spines, when creating a clock spine structure and the tool is not detecting and using existing spines, use the -spine_direction option. To shield the straps with power and ground nets, use the -bias option. To shield the straps with specific nets, use the -bias_to_nets with the list of nets. To specify the distance from the shielding nets, use the -bias_margins option. To remove the straps of a specific clock net, use the -clear option. For example, the following command creates a clock mesh for the net named clk1_mesh that is bounded by coordinates (0,0) and (1200, 980). The straps are on layers M7 and M8 with a width of 2.4 units and of type stripe. The horizontal straps on layer M7 start at a distance of 20 units from the x-axis and repeat every 100 units, until they reach 1200 units from the x-axis.

Define the detail routing application options For information about the detail routing application options, see the route.detail_options man page. Complete global routing and track assignment The detail router uses the general pathways suggested by global routing and track assignment to route the nets, and then it divides the block into partitions and looks for DRC violations in each partition. When the detail router finds a violation, it rips up the wire and reroutes it to fix the violation. During detail routing, Zroute concurrently addresses routing design rules and antenna rules and optimizes via count and wire length. For more information about antenna rules, see Finding and Fixing Antenna Violations To perform standalone detail routing, run the route_detail command. By default, the route_detail command Performs detail routing on the whole block You can restrict the routing to a specific area of the block by using the -coordinates option (or by specifying or selecting the bounding box in the GUI). Uses one uniform partition for the first iteration and adjusts the partitioning for subsequent iterations Zroute uses the single uniform partition for the first iteration to generate all DRC violations for the chip at the same time. At the beginning of each subsequent iteration, the router checks the distribution of the DRC violations. If the DRC violations are evenly distributed, the detail router uses a uniform partition. If the DRC violations are located in some local areas, the detail router uses nonuniform partitions. In some cases, such as when a design contains standard cells with long pins, you can improve the detail routing QoR and reduce the runtime by increasing the partition size. To enable this feature, set the route.detail.optimize_partition_size_for_drc application option to true Performs iterations until one of the following conditions exists: All of the violations have been fixed The maximum number of iterations has been reached By default, the maximum number of iterations is 40. You can change this limit by setting the -max_number_iterations option. fc_shell> route_detail -max_number_iterations 20 It cannot fix any of the remaining violations You can change the effort that the detail router uses for fixing the remaining violations before it gives up by setting the route.detail.drc_convergence_effort_level application option. fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name route.detail.drc_convergence_effort_level -value high You can force the detail router to complete the maximum number of iterations, regardless of the DRC convergence status, by setting the route.detail.force_max_number_iterations application option to true fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name route.detail.force_max_number_iterations -value true Is not timing-driven To enable timing-driven detail routing, set the route.detail.timing_driven application option to true fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name route.detail.timing_driven -value true By default, when you enable timing-driving detail routing, Zroute uses medium effort to assign timing-critical nets to low-resistance metal layers. To change the extent to which timing-driven detail routing prefers lower-resistance metal layers when routing timing- critical nets, set the route.common.rc_driven_setup_effort_level application option. To increase the effort level to use more low-resistance metal layers for routing, set the option to high. To reduce the effort level, set the option to low. To disable resistance-based routing layer preferences, set the option to off Does not fix shorted nets over macro cells If default detail routing leaves shorted nets over macro cells, analyze the block to determine if the shorts are caused by the availability of only a single layer for routing over the macro cells. If so, use routing guides to encourage river routing over the macros with shorted nets and rerun detail routing. For details, see Using Routing Guides to Encourage River Routing If shorted nets remain after using river routing, enable the fixing of shorted nets over macro cells by automatically ripping up and rerouting the shorted nets by setting the route.detail.repair_shorts_over_macros_effort_level application option to low medium, or high and running incremental detail routing.

To turn on the early mode in detail routing, use the set_qor_strategy command with the -mode option set as early fc_shell> set_qor_strategy -mode early -stage pnr Early mode detail routing automatically creates a new DRC type called skipped regions that can detect dirty regions with pin overflow. To identify the dirty regions, open the error browser and select Skipped region If you want to view the DRC violations before postroute optimization, you can save the block after a specified number of iterations by setting the route.detail.save_after_iterations application option. The saved block is called DR_itr, where n is the specified iteration. You can use a string other than DR as the prefix by setting the route.detail.save_cell_prefix application option. Zroute generates a DRC violations summary at the end of each iteration. After completing detail routing, Zroute outputs a final summary report. This report includes all violations detected by Zroute, as well as information about the redundant via conversion rates. If you want an additional report that excludes violations that are not of interest to you, specify the rules to exclude by setting the route.detail.report_ignore_drc application option. The syntax to set this option is set_app_options -name route.detail.report_ignore_drc -value list_of_drcs The values used in the list_of_drcs argument are the DRC names used in the summary report. If the DRC name includes a space, you must enclose the name in double quotation marks. For a complete list of the supported DRC names, see the man page. Example 21 shows a detail routing report.

To legalize the placement of only the relative placement groups, but not nonrelative placement cells, use the legalize_rp_groups command. You can also specify a list of relative placement groups to be legalized. To perform a fast legalization of the relative placement groups, use the -prototype option. When you use this option, the tool does not ensure that all legalization constraints are met. Therefore, use it during the prototyping stages of the design flow when you are developing relative placement groups. To specify that relative placement groups can overlap with each other, use the -legalize_over_rp option. For example, the following command legalizes the RP3 relative placement group over the RP1 and RP2 relative placement groups. fc_shell> legalize_rp_groups -legalize_over_rp RP3 shows the placement before and after running the command. Legalizing the RP3 Relative Placement Group Over Other Groups RP1 RP2 RP1 RP2 RP3 After you legalize one or more relative placement groups by using the legalize_rp_groups command, there might be overlaps with cells in other relative placement groups or cells that are not in relative placement groups.

Specifying Nondefault Vias Using the -vias Option The syntax for specifying nondefault vias using the -vias option is create_routing_rule rule_name -vias { { via_type cut_number orientation via_type cut_number orientation... via_type cut_number orientation You can specify multiple via types per layer; each via type must be a via definition defined in the technology file or a via definition created by the create_via_def command. For each via type, you must explicitly specify the allowed cut numbers and orientation. To specify the orientation, use NR to indicate that the via is not rotated or to indicate that the via is rotated. The order of via specification is not important; during routing, Zroute selects the lowest cost nondefault via. For example, to specify the vias selected by the -cuts option in the previous example, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule via_rule \\ -vias { {VIA12_LH 1x1 R} {VIA12_LH 1x1 NR} {VIA12_LV 1x1 R} {VIA12_LV 1x1 NR} {VIA12_LH 1x2 R} {VIA12_LH 1x2 NR} {VIA12_LH 2x1 R} {VIA12_LH 2x1 NR} {VIA12_LV 1x2 R} {VIA12_LV 1x2 NR} {VIA12_LV 2x1 R} {VIA12_LV 2x1 NR} } Specifying Mask Constraints If you are using the precolored design flow for a design that uses multiple-patterning technology, you can set mask constraints on timing-critical nets, such as clock nets, by defining a precoloring rule and applying it to the nets. For details about the mask constraints, see Mask Constraints To define a precoloring rule, use the create_routing_rule command using the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name -mask_constraints layer constraint layer constraint... layer constraint where constraint is one of same_mask mask1_soft, or mask2_soft For example, to define a precoloring routing rule that sets mask_one constraints on the M4 and M5 layers, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule clock_mask1 \\ -mask_constraints {M4 mask_one M5 mask_one} Note: To ensure DRC convergence, you should set double-patterning mask constraints only on a very few timing-critical nets. Defining Shielding Rules To define shielding rules, use the create_routing_rule command using the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name -shield_widths { layer width layer width layer width -shield_spacings { layer spacing layer spacing layer spacing [-snap_to_track] Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. You can define a single width and spacing value per layer. Zroute uses the default wire width for any layers not specified in the -shield_widths option and the default spacing for any layers not specified in the -shield_spacings option. By default, shielding wires are not snapped to the routing tracks. To snap shielding wires to the routing tracks, use the -snap_to_track option when you define the nondefault routing rule. For example, to specify a shielding rule that uses spacing of 0.1 microns and a width of 0.1 microns for M1 through M5 and spacing of 0.3 microns and a width of 0.3 microns for M6, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule shield_rule \\ -shield_widths {M1 0.1 M2 0.1 M3 0.1 M4 0.1 M5 0.1 M6 0.3} \\ -shield_spacings {M1 0.1 M2 0.1 M3 0.1 M4 0.1 M5 0.1 M6 0.3} Reporting Nondefault Routing Rule Definitions To report the nondefault routing rules defined by the create_routing_rule command, use the report_routing_rules -verbose command. By default, this command reports all of the nondefault routing rules for the current block. To limit the report to specific nondefault routing rules, specify the rule names as an argument to the command. fc_shell> report_routing_rules { rule_names To output a Tcl script that contains the create_routing_rule commands used to define the specified nondefault routing rules, use the -output option when you run the report_routing_rules command. Removing Nondefault Routing Rules To remove nondefault routing rules from the current block, use the remove_routing_rules command. When you remove a nondefault routing rule, the rule is removed from all nets to which it is applied and the rule definition is removed from the design library. To remove specific routing rules, specify the routing rules. To remove all routing rules, specify the -all option. For example, to remove the new_width_rule routing rule, use the following command: fc_shell> remove_routing_rules new_width_rule Modifying Nondefault Routing Rules To change the definition for an existing rule, you must use the remove_routing_rules command to remove the rule and then use the create_routing_rule command to redefine the rule. The tool issues an error message if you try to redefine an existing routing rule."}]}

When you define a via access-preference area, you are defining a preference area for the via surrounds on the specified metal layer for vias coming from both above and below that metal layer. To create this type of routing guide, use the -access_preference option with the create_routing_guide command.

By default, Zroute uses distance-based pin tapering; it uses the default routing rule within the tapering distance from the pin and uses the nondefault routing rule beyond the tapering distance. However, advanced process nodes are very sensitive to jogs and fat metal, and sometimes the tapering distance is not sufficient to fix the routing DRC violations on nets with nondefault routing rules. In these cases, you can use layer-based tapering, which targets DRC violations on nets with nondefault routing rules. Note: Distance-based tapering and layer-based tapering are mutually exclusive. If you define a routing rule that uses both a distance-based tapering option and a layer-based tapering option, the tool uses the layer-based tapering settings and ignores the distance-based tapering settings. When Zroute performs distance-based pin tapering, it Determines the tapering distance, which is about 10 times the mean number of tracks for all routing layers. To explicitly specify the tapering distance, use the -taper_distance option when you create a nondefault routing rule with the create_routing_rule command. Uses the same tapering distance for all pins. To specify a different tapering distance for driver pins, use the -driver_taper_distance option when you create a nondefault routing rule with the create_routing_rule command. To perform layer-based pin tapering, use the -taper_over_pin_layers or -taper_under_pin_layers option when you create a nondefault routing rule with the create_routing_rule command.

Performs layer hopping to fix antenna violations Layer hopping decreases the antenna ratio by splitting a large metal polygon into several upper-level polygons. Zroute performs the following types of layer hopping: Breaking the antenna with a higher-level metal segment Zroute uses this technique to fix most antenna violations. For antenna violations that happen at metal-N, inserting a small segment of metal-(N+1) close to the gate reduces the ratio between the remaining metal-N, making the ratio much lower. This approach is not suitable for fixing top-metal layer antenna violations when the output pin can provide only limited protection because there is no way for the router to break antenna violations at the topmost metal layer. Moving down to a lower-level metal Zroute uses this technique to fix only topmost layer antenna violations when output pins provide only limited protection. For antenna violations that happen at metal-N, replace part of the metal-N with metal-(N-1 or lower) to reduce the ratio. However, splitting the metal layer into many pieces might have a negative impact on RC and timing delay. Zroute can also insert diodes to fix antenna violations.

How to perform antenna ratio calculation with diode protection (the diode ratio vector) To specify the diode ratio vector, use the -diode_ratio option with the define_antenna_layer_rule command, as described in Specifying the Diode Ratio Vector. This is a required option of the define_antenna_layer_rule command. Setting the Diode Protection Mode The diode protection mode specifies how much protection the diodes provide. Advanced technology designs often use cells and macros with different gate oxide thicknesses, which affect the antenna rule calculations. The Fusion Compiler tool uses gate classes to represent the various gate oxide thicknesses. The tool supports up to four gate oxide thicknesses: gate class 0, gate class 1, gate class 2, and gate class 3. If a cell pin does not have gate class data, it is treated as gate class 0. The Fusion Compiler tool supports 18 diode protection modes, most of which support only a single gate oxide thickness. For advanced technology designs that use cells and macros with different gate oxide thicknesses, you must use one of the diode protection modes that support multiple gate oxide thicknesses: 14, 16, and 18. To specify the diode protection mode, use the -diode_mode option with the define_antenna_rule command. This is a required option of the define_antenna_rule command. Table 35 defines how each of the diode protection mode settings affect the maximum antenna ratio for a net. The diode protection mode also affects the computation of the maximum antenna ratio for individual diodes. The antenna ratio calculation formulas for diodes are shown in Table 37 ; these formulas use the values in the diode ratio vector specified in the -diode_ratio option of the define_antenna_layer_rule command, as described in Specifying the Diode Ratio Vector Table 35 Diode Protection Mode Settings Diode protection mode Definition Table 35 Diode Protection Mode Settings (Continued) Diode protection mode Definition Specifying the Diode Ratio Vector The diode ratio vector specifies the values used to calculate the maximum antenna ratio.

You can control the placement of a top-level relative placement group by anchoring it. To anchor a relative placement group, use the set_rp_group_options command with the -x_offset and -y_offset options. The offset values are float values, in microns, relative to the lower-left corner in the core area. If you specify both the x- and y-coordinates, the group is anchored at that location. If you specify only one coordinate, the Fusion Compiler tool determines the placement by maintaining the specified coordinate and sliding the group along the line passing through the unspecified coordinate.

To ignore nondefault spacing rules between signal nets and blockages For all signal nets, set the route.common.ignore_var_spacing_to_blockage application option to true For specific signal nets, use the -ignore_spacing_to_blockage true option when you define the nondefault spacing rule with the create_routing_rule command You can relax the nondefault spacing checks for specific nondefault routing rules by ignoring violations for short parallel distances, as shown in. This technique increases the flexibility of DRC convergence without adversely affecting crosstalk. Ignoring Nondefault Spacing Rule Violations To define the length thresholds within which to ignore the nondefault spacing violations, use the -spacing_length_thresholds option when you create the nondefault routing rule with the create_routing_rule command. The length threshold values are in microns and must have a one-to-one correspondence with the spacing entries specified in the -spacings option. For example, fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_rule \\ -spacings { M1 {0.09 0.15 0.2} M2 {0.09 0.15 0.2} M3 {0.09 0.15 0.2} } \\ -spacing_weight_levels { M1 {hard medium low} M2 {hard medium low} M3 {hard medium low} } \\ -spacing_length_thresholds { M1 {0.01 0 0} M2 {0.01 0 0} M3 {0.01 0 0} } Specifying the Routing Effort for Soft Spacing Violations By default, Zroute does not fix soft spacing violations. To fix soft spacing violations, you must assign a routing effort to each of the soft weight levels. These assignments apply to all soft spacing rules. To assign a routing effort for each weight level, use the following syntax to set the route.common.soft_rule_weight_to_effort_level_map application option: set_app_options -name route.common.soft_rule_weight_to_effort_level_map -value { { weight effort }... } Each weight argument can be one of low medium, or high. You should specify each weight level only one time; if you specify a weight level multiple times, the router uses the last specification. Each effort argument can be one of the following values: off (the default) Zroute does not fix the soft spacing rule violations. low Zroute uses a small number of rip-up and reroute passes to resolve soft spacing rule violations. medium Zroute uses a medium number of rip-up and reroute passes to resolve soft spacing rule violations. Note that you cannot specify this effort level for the low weight level. high Zroute treats soft spacing rule violations the same as regular design rule violations during rip up and reroute. Note that you cannot specify this effort level for the low weight level. For example, to assign low routing effort to low-weight soft spacing rules, medium routing effort to medium-weight soft spacing rules, and high routing effort to high-weight soft spacing, use the following command: fc_shell> set_app_options \\ -name route.common.soft_rule_weight_to_effort_level_map \\ -value { {low low} {medium medium} {high high} } Defining Minimum Via Spacing Rules You can define nondefault minimum via spacing rules that are stricter than the rules defined in the technology file. Nondefault via spacing rules are hard constraints that must be met. To define a minimum via spacing rule, use the -via_spacings option with the create_routing_rule command using the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name -via_spacings { { layer1 layer2 spacing }... } Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. You can define a single width value per layer pair. The minimum via spacing for vias between any unspecified layer combinations is determined from the technology file. For vias on the same layer, the router uses the minimum spacing defined in the Layer section for the via layer. For vias on different layers, the router uses the minimum spacing defined in the DesignRule section for the via layer combination. For example, to define a nondefault routing rule named via_spacing_rule that defines nondefault spacing rules between vias on the V1 layer and between vias on the V1 and V2 layers, and uses the minimum spacing rules defined in the technology file between vias on all other layer combinations, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule via_spacing_rule \\ -via_spacings {{V1 V1 2.3} {V1 V2 3.2}} Specifying Nondefault Vias By default, when routing nets with nondefault routing rules, Zroute selects vias based on the design rules. To specify the vias to use when routing nets with nondefault routing rules, use the create_routing_rule command. You can define the nondefault vias by using either the -cuts option or the -vias option. When you use the -cuts option, the tool determines the suitable via definitions from the technology file based on the specification in the -cuts option and the rules defined in the technology file. When you use the -vias option, you explicitly specify the nondefault via definitions, including the allowed cut numbers and rotation for each via definition. Specifying Nondefault Vias Using the -cuts Option The syntax for specifying nondefault vias using the -cuts option is create_routing_rule rule_name -cuts { { cut_layer1 cut_name1 ncuts } { cut_name2 ncuts } \u2026} cut_layer2 cut_name1 ncuts } { cut_name2 ncuts } \u2026}... cut_layern cut_name1 ncuts } { cut_name2 ncuts } \u2026} The cut_layer arguments refer to the via layer names in the technology file and the cut_name arguments refer to the cut names defined in the cutNameTbl attribute in the associated Layer section in the technology file. You can specify multiple cut names per layer. For each cut name, you must specify the minimum number of cuts, which must be an integer between 1 and 255. The tool searches for the vias defined in the ContactCode section of the technology file that meet the rules defined in the technology file for the specified cut name, such as the cutWidthTbl cutHeightTbl, and fatTblFatContactNumber rules. In addition, the width of the via enclosure must meet the nondefault width and the xLegalWidthTbl and yLegalWidthTbl rules defined in the technology file for the adjacent metal layers. If the fat metal contact rule is not defined for a via layer, the tool searches for the default vias that meet the cut width, cut height, and via enclosure width requirements. The minimum number of cuts required is the larger of the ncuts value in the -cuts option and the value defined in the fatTblFatContactMinCuts attribute. For the selected vias, the tool always allows both the rotated and unrotated orientations for the via. For example, assume the following information is defined in the technology file: Layer \"VIA1\" { fatTblThreshold = ( 0, 0.181, 0.411 ) fatTblFatContactNumber = ( \"2,3,4,5,6 \",\"5,6,20\", \"5,6,20\" ) fatTblFatContactMinCuts = ( \"1,1,1,1,1\", \"1,1,1\", \"2,2,2\" ) cutNameTbl = ( Vsq, Vrect ) cutWidthTbl = ( 0.05, 0.05 ) cutHeightTbl = ( 0.05, 0.13 ) ContactCode \"VIA12_LH\" { contactCodeNumber = 5 cutWidth = 0.13 cutHeight = 0.05 ContactCode \"VIA12_LV\" { contactCodeNumber = 6 cutWidth = 0.05 cutHeight = 0.13 ContactCode \"VIA12_P\" { contactCodeNumber = 20 cutWidth = 0.05 cutHeight = 0.05 If you use the following command, fc_shell> create_routing_rule cut_rule -cuts {VIA1 {Vrect 1}} The tool selects the following vias: {VIA12_LH 1x1 R}, {VIA12_LH 1x1 NR}, {VIA12_LV 1x1 R}, {VIA12_LV 1x1 NR}, {VIA12_LH 1x2 R}, {VIA12_LH 1x2 NR}, {VIA12_LH 2x1 R}, {VIA12_LH 2x1 NR}, {VIA12_LV 1x2 R}, {VIA12_LV 1x2 NR}, {VIA12_LV 2x1 R}, and {VIA12_LV 2x1 NR"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a chip design assistant. You should help the user to answer their question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I Assigning Nondefault Routing Rules to Nets"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To define a nondefault routing rule, use the create_routing_rule command. When you define a nondefault routing rule, you must specify a name for the nondefault routing rule. You use the name to assign the nondefault routing rule to nets or clocks. The following topics describe how to create nondefault routing rules for various purposes: Defining Minimum Wire Width Rules Defining Minimum Wire Spacing Rules Defining Minimum Via Spacing Rules Specifying Nondefault Vias Specifying Mask Constraints Defining Shielding Rules Reporting Nondefault Routing Rule Definitions Removing Nondefault Routing Rules Modifying Nondefault Routing Rules You can create a single routing rule that serves multiple purposes. In addition, you can assign multiple nondefault routing rules to a net. Defining Minimum Wire Width Rules You can define nondefault minimum wire width rules that are stricter than the minimum width rules defined in the technology file. Nondefault minimum width rules are hard constraints, which must be met during routing. Note: If you specify a nondefault width that violates the signalRouteMaxWidth setting in the technology file, the tool ignores the nondefault width. The minimum width defined in a nondefault routing rule applies to all metal segments, including via enclosures. To avoid DRC violations, ensure that the enclosures for nondefault vias meet the minimum width rule. To define a minimum wire width rule, use the create_routing_rule command. You can specify the minimum width by specifying a multiplier that is applied to the default width for each layer, by specifying the minimum width in microns for each layer, or both. To use a multiplier to specify the minimum width, use the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name [-default_reference_rule | -reference_rule_name ref_rule -multiplier_width multiplier The multiplier value must be between 0.001 and 2000. The default width for each layer is determined from the reference rule, which is either the default routing rule or the reference rule specified in the -reference_rule_name option. For example, to define a nondefault routing rule named new_width_rule that uses the default routing rule as the reference rule and defines the nondefault width as two times the default width, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_width_rule -multiplier_width 2.0 To specify the minimum width values for each layer, use the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name [-default_reference_rule | -reference_rule_name ref_rule -widths { layer width layer width layer width Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. You can specify a single width value per layer. Zroute uses the wire width from the reference rule, which is either the default routing rule or the reference rule specified in the -reference_rule_name option, for any layers not specified in the -widths option. For example, to define a nondefault routing rule named new_width_rule2 that uses the default routing rule as the reference rule and defines nondefault width rules for the M1 and M4 layers, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_width_rule2 \\ -widths {M1 0.8 M4 0.9} If you specify both with -multiplier_width option and the -widths option, the tool uses the -widths option to determine the base width, and then applies the multiplier to that value to determine the minimum width requirement. For example, to define a nondefault routing rule named new_width_rule3 that uses the default routing rule as the reference rule and defines the nondefault width as 0.8 for the M1 layer, 0.9 for the M4 layer, and two times the default width for all other layers, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_width_rule3 \\ -multiplier_width 2.0 -widths {M1 0.4 M4 0.45} Defining Minimum Wire Spacing Rules You can define nondefault minimum wire spacing rules that are stricter than the rules defined in the technology file. Nondefault wire spacing rules can be defined as hard constraints, which must be met, or as soft constraints, which Zroute tries to meet. Note: The spacing rules defined in the technology file are always considered hard constraints. By default, Zroute checks the nondefault spacing rules between signal nets and other signal nets, PG nets, and blockages, but not between shapes of the same signal net or between signal nets and shield wires for PG nets. For information about modifying these checks, see Configuring Nondefault Spacing Checks To define a minimum wire spacing rule, use the create_routing_rule command. You can specify the minimum spacing by specifying a multiplier that is applied to the default spacing for each layer, by specifying the minimum spacings in microns for each layer, or both. To use a multiplier to specify the minimum spacing, use the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name [-default_reference_rule | -reference_rule_name ref_rule -multiplier_spacing multiplier The multiplier value must be between 0.001 and 2000. The default wire spacing for each layer is determined from the reference rule, which is either the default routing rule or the reference rule specified in the -reference_rule_name option. For example, to define a nondefault routing rule named new_spacing_rule that uses the default routing rule as the reference rule and defines the nondefault spacing as two times the default spacing, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_spacing_rule \\ -multiplier_spacing 2.0 To specify the minimum spacing values for each layer, use the following syntax: create_routing_rule rule_name -spacings { layer spacing 11 spacing 12... spacing 1n layer spacing 21 spacing 22... spacing 2n... layer spacing n1 spacing n2...spacing nn } } -spacing_weight_levels { layer weight 11 weight 12... weight 1n layer weight 21 weight 22... weight 2n... layer weight n1 weight n2... weight nn } } Specify the routing layers by using the layer names from the technology file. You can define multiple spacing values per layer. Zroute uses the spacing values from the reference rule, which is either the default routing rule or the reference rule specified in the -reference_rule_name option, for any layers not specified in the -spacings option. If you specify more than one spacing value per layer, you must assign a weight to each spacing value by using the -spacing_weight_levels option. The valid weight values are low medium high, and hard. When you assign a weight level other than hard, the spacing rule is a soft spacing rule. By default, Zroute does not fix soft routing rule violations. To fix soft routing rules, you must map the weight levels to routing effort levels, as described in Specifying the Routing Effort for Soft Spacing Violations For example, to define a nondefault routing rule named new_spacing_rule2 that uses the default routing rule as the reference rule and defines nondefault spacing rules for the M1 and M4 layers, use the following command: fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_spacing_rule2 \\ -spacings { M1 {0.12 0.24} M4 {0.14 0.28} } \\ -spacing_weight_levels { M1 {hard medium} M4 {hard medium} } If you specify both with -multiplier_spacing option and the -spacings option, the tool uses the -spacings option to determine the base spacing, and then applies the multiplier to that value to determine the minimum wire spacing requirement. To limit spacing to one side of the net, use the -single_side_spacing option with the create_routing_rule command. For example, the following command creates single-side spacing rules on the M2, M3, and M4 metal layers METAL2, METAL3, and METAL4: fc_shell> create_routing_rule new_spacing_rule3 \\ -spacings {M2 1.300 M3 1.400 M4 1.500 } \\ -single_side_spacing \\ -widths {M1 0.230 M2 0.280 M3 0.280 M4 0.280 M5 0.280 M6 0.440} Configuring Nondefault Spacing Checks You can configure the checking of nondefault spacing rules by enabling or disabling checks between signal nets and other objects. In addition, you can ignore violations of nondefault spacing rules for short parallel distances. To honor nondefault spacing rules between shapes of the same signal net, set the route.detail.var_spacing_to_same_net application option to true To honor nondefault spacing rules between signal nets and shield wires for PG nets For all signal nets, set the route.common.ignore_var_spacing_to_shield application option to false For specific signal nets, use the -ignore_spacing_to_shield false option when you define the nondefault spacing rule with the create_routing_rule command To ignore nondefault spacing rules between signal nets and PG nets For all signal nets, set the route.common.ignore_var_spacing_to_pg application option to true For specific signal nets, use the -ignore_spacing"}]}

The checkpoints are named remove_buffers, place_opt_to_initial_drc, incr_placement, place_opt_to_initial_opto, and place_opt_to_final_opto. open_block./design.nlib:init_design source./scripts/pre_place_opt_settings.tcl eval_checkpoint remove_buffers { remove_buffer_trees -all eval_checkpoint place_opt_to_initial_drc { place_opt -from initial_place -to initial_drc eval_checkpoint incr_placement { create_placement -incremental -timing_driven -congestion eval_checkpoint place_opt_to_initial_opto { place_opt -from initial_drc -to initial_opto eval_checkpoint place_opt_to_final_opto { place_opt -from final_place -to final_opto By default, the checkpoints run the Tcl code they enwrap. That is, simply inserting checkpoints with the eval_checkpoint command does not change your flow. However, you can associate these checkpoints with flow changes or reports that you want to run before, after, or in place of the code the checkpoints enwrap, as described in Configuring Checkpoints See Also Configuring Checkpoints Querying Checkpoints and Checkpoint Behaviors"}]}

In general, the tracing terminates when it finds a clock pin of a sequential cell or macro; however, the tool traces through sequential cells if they are integrated clock-gating (ICG) cells or their fanout drives a generated clock. If the clock-gating logic uses a non-unate cell, such as an XOR or XNOR gate, the tool uses both the positive-unate timing arc and the negative-unate timing arc when tracing the clock path. If this does not correspond to the functional mode of the block, use the set_case_analysis command to hold all nonclock inputs of the cell at a constant value, which forces the cell into the required functional mode for clock tree synthesis.

You can use routing guides and blockages to enable access to the hard macro pins. To create these routing guides, which are referred to as pin access routing guides, and the associated blockages, use the derive_pin_access_routing_guides command. You must specify the following information: The hard macros around which to create the routing guides and routing blockages (the -cells option) The metal layers for which to create the routing guides and routing blockages (the -layers option) The width of the routing guides and blockages in the x- and y-directions (the -x_width and -y_width options) For each specified hard macro, the command creates routing guides to enable routing to the pins on the specified layers. In addition, the command creates metal blockages that surround the macro on the specified layers, with cutouts to allow pin access, and via blockages that cover the macro on the via layers adjacent to the specified metal layers. Vertical routing guides and blockages have the specified x-width. Horizontal routing guides and blockages have the specified y-width. By default, the command creates pin cutouts only in the preferred routing direction. To also create pin cutouts in the nonpreferred direction, use the -nonpreferred_direction option. To extend the pin cutouts beyond the metal blockages, use the -pin_extension option to specify the extension distance in microns. To enable proper routing to pins of different sizes, the command sets the is_rectangle_only_rule_waived attribute on the macro pins to true to waive the rectangle-only rule. For example, the following command creates the routing guides and blockages shown in fc_shell> derive_pin_access_routing_guides -cells myMacro \\ -layers {M2 M3} -x_width 0.6 -y_width 0.7 In the figure, the two red pins are on M2 and the green pin is on M3. The figure shows the routing guides created on both the M2 and M3 layers, the metal blockages created on the M3 layer, and the via blockage created on the V2 and V3 layers. The tool also creates metal blockages on the M2 layer, which have cutouts for the M2 pins, and via blockages on the V1 and V2 layers. Pin Access Routing Guides and Blockages If a hard macro already has pin access routing guides and their associated blockages, the command removes these existing objects and creates new routing guides and blockages. If you move a hard macro after deriving the pin access routing guides, you must regenerate the pin access routing guides. You cannot manually modify pin access routing guides."}]}

To enable this feature, set the route_opt.flow.enable_voltage_drop_opt_ccd application option to true When you enable this feature, during the route_opt command, the tool uses the RedHawk Fusion feature to identify dynamic-voltage-drop hotspots and cells rows where the cells from the hotspots can be relocated. Then, during optimization, the tool relocates or downsizes the cells in the hotspots to reduce the peak dynamic voltage drop without hurting the timing QoR. You can specify one of the following thresholds for selecting cells for optimization: A threshold for the cell voltage drop, as a percentage of the supply voltage, by using the ccd.voltage_drop_voltage_threshold application option. Any cell with a voltage drop that exceeds this threshold is selected for optimization. A threshold for the number of cells, as a percentage of the total number of cells, by using the ccd.voltage_drop_population_threshold application option. Cells are selected starting with the worst violator. During postroute optimization, the tool can perform RedHawk dynamic voltage drop analysis to identify cells involved in voltage drop violations, and then use optimization techniques on those cells to improve the dynamic voltage drop. You can further improve the dynamic voltage drop by enabling IR-driven sizing, which uses the RedHawk dynamic voltage drop analysis results to identify cells involved in voltage drop violations, and then tries to replace those cells with cells having smaller leakage current.

Here is a typical example to run the place_opt flow, where you source a pre_place_opt_settings.tcl file to add flow changes and a generate_reports.tcl file to run all your reporting at the end of the script: open_block./design:init_design source./scripts/pre_place_opt_settings.tcl remove_buffer_trees -all place_opt -from initial_place -to initial_drc create_placement -incremental -timing_driven -congestion place_opt -from initial_drc -to -initial_opto place_opt -from final_place -to final_opto source./scripts/generate_reports.tcl In some cases, complex changes require modifying your golden flow script directly, which might be discouraged or difficult to do in many design environments. These changes can be time consuming to implement, especially if you are implementing them at multiple stages in the design flow, across multiple blocks, or for several different flow experiments. The checkpoint system streamlines this process and allows you to run experiments without modifying your golden flow scripts. When you use the checkpoint system, you define checkpoints for important steps in your golden flow. These checkpoints enwrap the commands associated with the given steps. By default, the checkpoints run only the code they enwrap. That is, simply inserting checkpoints in your script does not change your flow. However, you can associate these checkpoints with flow changes or reports that you want to run before, after, or in place of the code the checkpoints enwrap. By defining these associations in a portable configuration file, you isolate your golden flow scripts from the changes you want to apply for a particular run. The following figure shows how you can use checkpoints to instantly apply a set of flow changes or reports to multiple designs, without modifying each design's golden flow script. In this case, the configuration file has been copied to each design's run directory. In addition, when multiple users are working on a project, each user can have an individual checkpoint.config.tcl file with his or her preferred settings: The checkpoint system also allows you to Insert flow changes and reports with more precision than you could using a typical non- checkpointed flow script Reference a single source of truth where you can find all changes that have been applied to your default golden flow Report a history of the checkpoints that were run, including the flow changes or reports that were run at those checkpoints Report runtime and memory information for each checkpoint that was run Generate unique and descriptive report names The general process for using the checkpoint system is as follows: 1. Insert checkpoints in your script 2. Configure your checkpoints by Defining the flow changes or reports you want to associate with the checkpoints Associating the flow changes or reports you defined with your checkpoints 3. Run your script."}]}

To prevent the cell from being placed in the category blockage, set the attribute to true. To allow the cell in the category blockage, set the attribute to false When defining and applying attributes, observe the following rules: A blockage can only be controlled by a single attribute. Multiple blockages can be controlled by the same attribute. A cell can have multiple attributes, which could impact its placement in multiple category blockages. The same attribute can be applied to a reference and an instance. If a cell instance and its reference have different attributes, the attribute on the cell instance takes precedence. 2.
